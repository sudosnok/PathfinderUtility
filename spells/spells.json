    "description": "You awaken a tree or animal to human-like sentience. to succeed, you must make a will save (dc 10 + the animal's current hd, or the hd the tree will have once awakened). the awakened animal or tree is friendly toward you. you have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it. if you cast awaken again, any previously awakened creatures remain friendly to you, but they no longer undertake tasks for you unless it is in their best interests.an awakened tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that it gains the plant type and its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores are each 3d6. an awakened plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human's.an awakened animal gets 3d6 intelligence, +1d3 charisma, and +2 hd. its type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). an awakened animal can't serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.an awakened tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of intelligence bonus (if any). this spell does not function on an animal or plant with an intelligence greater than 2.editor's noteif you cast awaken, an animal's type changes to magical beast. do you change its hd to d10s, increase its bab to that of a magical beast, and gain other features of the magical beast type? it also gains two hit dice; are these d8s or d10s? if the animal was trained to wear barding, does it retain this ability once it is awakened? if the animal wasn't trained to wear barding, how can the awakened creature learn how to wear armor?only the animal's type changes to magical beast, it doesn't gain all the mathematical benefits for this type change (think of it as a \u201cquick rules\u201d version of adding a template to a creature).the 2 hd it gains are d8s.an animal trained to wear barding can continue to do so without penalty once it is awakened. once it's awakened, it can either spend a feat on armor proficiency or take class levels in a class that grants armor proficiency, just like any intelligent creature.[source]intelligent animalssource: animal archiveone of the surest ways to complicate the relationship between an adventurer and her animal companion is to cast awaken on the beast. the moment the spell takes effect, an animal companion ceases to be a class feature, and instead becomes a person\u2014an npc whose intelligence has increased by 3d6 (potentially making it as smart as or smarter than the caster), and who has an increased charisma score and knows at least one spoken language.an adventurer considering awakening his animal companion should keep in mind the awaken spell's potential drawbacks. most pointedly, awakened animals can no longer serve as companions, and the character must follow the rules for leadership if he wishes to take the animal as an official cohort. further, an intelligent animal can be difficult to manage. after awakening, animals are predisposed to be friendly toward whoever cast the spell\u2014 in this case, presumably their masters. yet if an animal was mistreated during its time as a companion, or is treated poorly after its awakening, that friendliness is mixed with a sense of confusion that can last anywhere from a few moments to a few hours as the animal reconciles the abuse with the great gift it's been given. since awaken is not a charm or mind-control spell, there's nothing to prevent awakened animals from resenting mistreatment in the same way a normal person of their intelligence level would, and they're no more inclined to be automatically servile than anyone else. more than one careless druid has found her awakened animal companion refusing to follow instructions, leaving to pursue its own goals, or even seeking vengeance for its former \u201censlavement.\u201don the flip side, there are many advantages to awakening an animal companion. if treated well, an awakened animal may become a valuable member of an adventuring party, adding new perspective to problems and fighting alongside its friends. awakened animals can also make stealthy and reliable snoops (for who guards her words in front of a dog?), teach adventurers about their native environments, act as guides, and provide a valuable surprise weapon against enemies who think them mere brutes. druids, in particular, may find awakening animal companions appealing\u2014either because they wish to become true friends with their companions, or because they would value the animals\u2018 skills as allies. a devious druid, upon witnessing an enemy mistreating its companion, may even cast awaken in secret upon the beast, trusting that its natural instincts will make it turn on its oppressor.although the personalities of awakened animals are as varied as those of adventurers, augmented animals often exhibit traits hearkening back to their species. similarly, certain types of animals may favor specific classes, battle tactics, or even weapons. the following are examples of some broad animal groups' commonalities.avians: raptors such as eagles, hawks, and owls\u2014as well as more bizarre fliers\u2014tend to develop aloof, detached personalities, while smaller individuals are often more social and high-strung. awakened avian animals keenly observe the world around them\u2014often understanding it much better than their demure natures might imply\u2014 and are adept at inferring others' desires, motives, and intentions. these intelligent flyers are shrewdly calculating and opportunistic, especially when it comes to ensuring their own survival. awakened birds can often be found high above a fracas, coldly deciding on the best course of action, and only entering a fray when it's in their best interest or that of their friends.in combat, avian animals enjoy taking opponents by surprise, favoring training as rogues and ninjas, though they may also enjoy a bard's ability to soar above the fray and inspire with their songs and majestic screeches. in these capacities, the birds often use their winged stealth to their advantage, taking cover in trees and then striking quickly and silently. awakened avian animals use their natural weapons, but often with a twist\u2014devious awakened flyers have been known to drop smoke shot, chain shot, and even bombs on unsuspecting enemies.land mammals (large): relishing their brute size and strength, large mammals\u2014such as bison, lions, and rhinoceroses\u2014tend to divide along predator/prey lines. herbivores tend to be generally docile but easily spooked or enraged, while predators are aggressive and cunning, constantly seeking social dominance. whether they're among cowering villagers or in a raiding party, these animals love to tell stories of their physical prowess, and awakened large animals tend to be the worst kind of braggadocios.in combat, most large animals gravitate toward brash, volatile tactics, becoming barbarians or fighters who enjoy wading into battle before thinking. the exceptions are those hunters like the great cats that rely on stealth and tracking, who are just as likely to become rogues or rangers as they are to become barbarians. some large mammals, however, have been known to become samurai, replacing their natural affinity for recklessness with precision and discipline.large mammals recognize the value in using their natural weapons, and augment those weapons in any way they can. for a rhinoceros, that might mean sharpening its deadly horn, while a lion might tip its claws with poison and a bison might overrun its enemies with spiked chainmail affixed to its chest.land mammals (small and medium): encompassing perhaps the widest variety of species\u2014including creatures like cheetahs, hyenas, ponies, and weasels\u2014small andmedium mammals tend to adopt mischievous, resourceful personalities when awakened. used to living in vast ecosystems full of larger predators, these creatures are accustomed to using any advantage they have, banding together with allies or manipulating others to serve their own designs.in battle, these animals tend to be smart and savvy, shrewd at observing situations and determining whether it would be most advantageous to fight or run. those animals who prefer combat to diplomacy tend to value speed and stealth, thus making barbarians and rogues natural choices, yet the natural curiosity of many smaller animals may also lead them to the study of magic, from wizardry to druidism, which brings their own environments under their control. these creatures tend to be opportunistic, perpetually on the lookout for interesting magic items to help augment their natural abilities.aquatic animals: often as mysterious as the depths in which they live, ocean dwellers are predisposed to developing deep, philosophical personalities when awakened. the reflective natures of animals such as giant squid, whales, and dolphins typically manifest in one of two ways: they either find majesty in nature or adopt a religion. once awakened, aquatic animals also tend to be the most creative and artistic group of creatures.of all awakened creatures, aquatic animals are the most likely to become clerics or paladins\u2014or cult leaders, for that matter. aquatic animals who eschew religion may instead pursue training as druids or bards, or crave the intellectual stimulation of wizardry. in battle, aquatic animals prefer to rely on the gifts their personal beliefs provide, casting divine spells or weaving intricate battle songs and spells. as a rule, aquatic animals eschew combat and fight only when necessary for survival unless an enemy threatens something the animal holds sacred. because they so dislike combat, aquatic animals rarely alter their natural weapons.primates: perhaps the most human in their perspectives, augmented primates such as monkeys, baboons, and gorillas tend to have a wide range of personalities. most are highly social and communicative, though this does not always make them great allies as they form intense attachments, manipulate others, and vie for dominance. perhaps reflecting their impulsive personalities, primates generally pursue whatever paths seem appropriate in any given moment, and are likely to multiclass, training as anything from barbarians, fighters, rangers, and rogues, to exotic callings such as gunslingers and even magi. those smaller primates used to traveling quickly through trees make great burglars and sailors, while gorillas and chimpanzees make better mercenaries and berserkers, charging into foes with terrifying force. the weapons primates wield also run the gamut. a gorilla might choose an enormous club, a chimpanzee a two-handed sword that lets him take advantage of his tremendous strength, and a monkey a hand crossbow or blunderbuss.reptiles: from the lizard to the constrictor snake to the ankylosaurus, awakened reptiles tend to be haughty and disdainful toward others. they eschew company whenever possible, preferring instead to be alone with their increasingly complex thoughts. although their gruff exteriors can be off-putting, once an adventurer has earned an awakened reptile's friendship, it lasts for a lifetime.when they are forced to pursue a discipline, smaller reptiles favor esoteric orders and studies, perhaps becoming druids, oracles, or even witches, while larger reptiles\u2014such as dinosaurs\u2014are often content to remain savagely effective barbarians. poisonous creatures might become rogues, ninjas, and assassins, supplementing their own poisons with those of others. though not necessarily evil, reptiles often retain predatory streaks that can seem cruel to others, and some crave violence and the thrill of the hunt over all. in combat, as in most things, reptiles rarely show anger or passion, instead pursuing their goals with cold, emotionless drive, their expressions nearly impossible for other creatures to read."

(for an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the material plane (but they might affect targets on the ethereal plane).while blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the ethereal plane). although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and targets retain their dexterity bonus to ac against your attacks. you do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures.you take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.while blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. for each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. if this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.since you spend about half your time on the ethereal plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. you interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.an ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. as an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.an ethereal creature can see and hear the material plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. sight and hearing on the material plane are limited to 60 feet.force effects and abjurations affect you normally. their effects extend onto the ethereal plane from the material plane, but not vice versa. an ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the ethereal plane. treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.mythicyou may spend a move action to remain corporeal or incorporeal until the end of your turn (you automatically resume blinking at the end of your turn).augmented (3rd): if you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend either a swift action or a move action to remain corporeal or incorporeal until the end of your turn.\r  section 15: copyright notice\r pathfinder rpg core rulebook. copyright 2009, paizo publishing, llc; author: jason bulmahn, based on material by jonathan tweet, monte cook, and skip williams.pathfinder roleplaying game mythic adventures \u00a9 2013, paizo publishing, llc; authors: jason bulmahn, stephen radney-macfarland, sean k reynolds, dennis baker, jesse benner, ben bruck, jim groves, tim hitchcock, tracy hurley, jonathan keith, jason nelson, tom phillips, ryan macklin, f. wesley schneider, amber scott, tork shaw, russ taylor, and ray vallese."

    "description": "Upon drinking an extract created with this formulae, you make a significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all bombs you create and throw during this extract's duration. this effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formulae with the word \u201cbomb admixture\u201d in its title) active at a time. if you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active. when you throw a bomb and hit a direct target, it creates an invisible cubical prison composed of a solid wall of force. the prison is as large as the splash area of the bomb that you threw, and traps any creature that is entirely inside the area. creatures within the area are caught and contained unless any creature within the splash radius is too big to fit inside, in which case the effect automatically fails. teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide means for escape, but the force walls extend into the ethereal plane, blocking ethereal travel. like a wall of force, the cage created by the caging bomb admixture resists dispel magic, although a mage's disjunction still functions. the walls of the cage can be damaged by spells as normal, except for disintegrate, which automatically destroys the cage. the walls of this cage can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but the cage has a hardness of 20 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per alchemist level. contact with a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation instantly destroys this cage. when using caging bomb admixture, an alchemist can only have one cage in effect at a time. if the alchemist throws another bomb during the duration of caging bomb admixture, any other cage created by the earlier admixture ends, and a new one is created. when the duration of the caging bomb admixture ends, so does any remaining cage created by this admixture's effect.section 15: copyright noticepathfinder roleplaying game ultimate combat. \u00a9 2011, paizo publishing, llc; authors: jason bulmahn, tim hitchcock, colin mccomb, rob mccreary, jason nelson, stephen radney-macfarland, sean k reynolds, owen k.c. stephens, and russ taylor."

while actively summoning them onto the material plane is evil, merely speaking with them is not necessarily so.contact entity imaterial componentcerebric fungusscholarly tomedeep oneengraved stone tabletgriothan eye struck blind during an eclipse [evil]nightgauntsculpture of an animal with the face filed smooth [chaotic]ratlingspell scroll of 1st (level or higher [chaotic, evil]voonithbundle of cattail plants [chaotic]contact entity iimaterial componentcolour out of spaceshard of a meteoritedenizen of lengpainting of a memory from a dream worth 1,000 gpelder thingmagic item or piece of technology worth 2,000 gphound of tindalosexotic, trance-inducing elixir worth 500 gpleng ghoulskull of a dead scholarmi-gofresh brains of an intelligent creature [evil]neh-thalgguvial of cerebrospinal fluid from a creature that still lives [chaotic, evil]rhu-chalikbrain of a creature that had 16 int or higher [evil]shantaka shard of rock harvested from another world [chaotic]yangethescroll of an emotion spell of 4th level or highercontact entity iiimaterial componentaatheriexaa swatch of flesh recently damaged by magic [evil]deep one elderengraved stone tabletflying polypeerie music played upon a wind instrument carved from the bone of a living creature [chaotic, evil]gugfresh flesh of a creature of 5 hd or more [chaotic, evil]leng spiderhead of a denizen of leng [evil]moon-beastintelligent humanoid sacrificed while dreaming [chaotic, evil]spawn of yog-sothothall blood drained from a sacrificed intelligent humanoid [chaotic, evil]wendigomust devour the flesh of sentient creatures with 8 hd total [chaotic, evil]yithianquartz geodecontact entity ivmaterial componentbholejar of slime created by a bhole's breath weaponbodythiefchunks of brain from a lobotomy subject [evil]neothelidruby worth 3,000 gp [chaotic, evil]shoggothart object worth 3,000 gp recovered from the bottom of a sea [chaotic]star-spawn of cthulhusacrificed humanoid of 10 hd or more [chaotic, evil]section 15: copyright noticepathfinder roleplaying game horror adventures \u00a9 2016, paizo inc.;

spell resistance nodescriptionyou create a small, finite demiplane. you must be on the astral or ethereal plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the material plane) to cast this spell. when you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the astral or the ethereal plane. it is filled with air or water (decided by you). the plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. the \u201cwalls\u201d and \u201cceiling\u201d of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. the plane's environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the material plane. you determine the plane's light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.there are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane's light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). the environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. for example, you could use move earth to create a hill or wall of stone to create a barricade.when you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. the demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as astral projection, etherealness, or plane shift. you are considered \u201cvery familiar\u201d with your entire demiplane.as a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. the creature may resist with a will saving throw. an ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the astral plane or the ethereal plane, but if you cast this spell on the material plane, the creature is sent to the material plane). when the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. the plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using limited wish, mage's disjunction, miracle, or wish and making a successful dispel check.if you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. if the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. if a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. you may reconnect these stranded sections by casting the spell again to create a linked area between the two.you can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp. if you have cast create lesser demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting's area requires its own permanency spell.section 15: copyright noticepathfinder roleplaying game: ultimate magic. \u00a9 2011, paizo publishing, llc;

    "description": "You create an immersive mindscape that the minds of both you and another creature enter together.you choose whether the mindscape is overt or veiled, and whether it's harmless or harmful. you can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can't make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within).the mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic.you designate where both you and your subject appear.you don't need line of sight to draw the subject creature into the mindscape, but you must be aware of its presence within range. if you target an area with more than one sentient creature and you have never seen any of the creatures before (for example, if you know a group of soldiers is inside a barracks but you can't see them through the door), the subject of this spell is selected at random. if you have seen firsthand the creature you wish to target (continuing the example, if you spied the sergeant entering the room moments before), you can select it unerringly from among all the creatures.you must appear somewhere in your mindscape, though it's relatively easy to shield yourself from the view of any other creatures inside if they don't realize they're in a mindscape.you must also create a method of exit from the mindscape when you cast this spell, and that method must be possible to achieve based on the traits of the mindscape, even if it is obscure or difficult. the gm decides whether a method of escape is reasonable. anything that would be a reasonable method of waking from a dream during deep sleep could allow one to leave a mindscape.more creatures than the initial two can enter an existing mindscape, typically through the use of the mindscape door spell. you can create illusory creatures within the mindscape, but you're able to direct or concentrate on only one at a time.only this creature is believable; any others largely remain silent or speak generic, repetitive phrases.as is normal with mindscapes, you and any other creatures within the mindscape are unable to take actions within the real world, and your bodies lose their dexterity bonuses to ac.if you choose to create a veiled mindscape, the first time another creature interacts with the environment, it can attempt a will save to disbelieve the effect. disbelieving a mindscape reveals to that creature that it's within a mindscape and gives it the knowledge needed to leave the mindscape, but doesn't free it from the mindscape. for example, if you create a mindscape that takes the form of a parlor inside a stately mansion, and your target creature succeeds at its will save, it gains the understanding that walking out the front door of the mansion allows it to return to its physical body, but it must actually move through the mental landscape of the mansion to reach the front door and exit in order to flee the mindscape. if the mindscape is overt, the creature automatically knows how to exit if it so chooses.this spell ends at any time that you choose to depart the mindscape, freeing the target as well. any creature that drops below 0 hit points while inside the mindscape returns to its body. if this happens to you, the spell also ends, freeing anyone still inside.create mindscape can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of 12th level or higher at a cost of 10,000 gp. you and other creatures aware of a permanent mindscape can come and go using the mindscape door spell.create mindscape, greaterschool illusion (phantasm)) [mind-affecting]; level mesmerist 6, psychic 6, sorcerer/wizard 7target one creature/levelduration 1 day/level this spell functions like create mindscape, except it can affect more creatures, the mindscape lasts longer, and you can choose the mindscape's magic trait. you can also direct a number of believable creatures at a time equal to your caster level.greater create mindscape can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of 15th level or higher at a cost of 17,500 gp. you and other creatures aware of a permanent mindscape can come and go using the mindscape door spell.section 15: copyright noticepathfinder roleplaying game occult adventures \u00a9 2015, paizo inc.; authors: john bennett, logan bonner, robert brookes, jason bulmahn, ross byers, john compton, adam daigle, jim groves, thurston hillman, eric hindley, brandon hodge, ben mcfarland, erik mona, jason nelson, tom phillips, stephen radney-macfarland, thomas m. reid, alex riggs, robert schwalb, mark seifter, russ taylor, and steve townshend."

(so, for instance, if two brothers are in the area and one succeeds at his will save, you could tell that they are siblings, but could not distinguish whether they are full- or half-siblings.) each round, you can turn to detect relations in a new area. the spell can penetrate barriers, but 6 inches of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 1 foot of wood or dirt will block it.this spell functions by analyzing the blood and minds of creatures in the area, collectively examining these traits and comparing them to those of others in the area while looking for patterns. thus, adoptive siblings and parents cannot be detected with this spell, since they share no blood.section 15: copyright noticepathfinder player companion: quests & campaigns \u00a9 2013, paizo publishing, llc; authors: amanda hamon and david n. ross."

    "description": "You can use dispel magic to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. a dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. the effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.you choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.targeted dispel: one object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. you make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (dc = 11 + the spell's caster level). if successful, that spell ends. if not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.for example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). the caster level check results in a 19. this check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.you can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). you must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. if your caster level check is equal to or higher than the dc of that spell, it ends. no other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.if you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.if the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (dc = 11 + the item's caster level). if you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. a suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. an interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. a magic item's physical properties are unchanged: a suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.you automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.counterspell: when dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.dispel magic, greaterschool abjuration; level bard 5, cleric/oracle 6, druid 6, inquisitor 6, magus 6, occultist 5, psychic 6, shaman 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, spiritualist 6, summoner/unchained summoner 5, witch 6;

otherwise, it is a random hostile outsider).5creature is affected as feeblemind.6creature is affected as insanity.traveling to a different planar destination decreases the accuracy of your dream transit. if you exit a creature's dream onto a plane different from the plane you started on, you end up in a random location on the destination plane.if the target of your dream travel isn't dreaming, you and the other travelers can wait on the dimension of dreams until that creature begins sleeping. for each hour that passes during this wait, each dream traveler must attempt a will save as if it were traveling to reach another plane.section 15: copyright noticepathfinder roleplaying game occult adventures \u00a9 2015, paizo inc.;

    "description": "You unleash a writhing tendril of ectoplasm to grapple or entangle a target creature. you must make a ranged touch attack to strike a target. if you hit, the target can attempt a reflex save. on a successful save, the target is entangled for the duration of the spell and suffers no other effects. if the target fails this saving throw, the tendril is more restrictive, making the target grappled and dealing it 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. each round when you concentrate to maintain the spell, the snare attempts a grapple combat maneuver check to maintain the grapple. as normal when grappling, the snare gains a +5 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks against opponents it is already grappling. the snare's cmb is equal to 6 + your caster level, and its cmd is equal to 16 + your caster level. since the ectoplasm passes between planes, this spell affects incorporeal and ethereal creatures normally.you remain tethered to the target for the duration of the spell. you can shrink or extend the snare, but if the distance between you and the target exceeds the spell's range, the snare disappears. the ectoplasmic tether has hardness 10 and a number of hit points equal to 10 + your caster level + your constitution modifier, and the tether can be damaged or sundered anywhere along its length. you are not considered to have the grappled condition while tethered to the target. you can perform the move or damage action on a successfully grappled target, moving it up to half your speed or dealing an additional 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage to it on a successful grapple combat maneuver check. you can't pin your target.section 15: copyright noticepathfinder roleplaying game occult adventures \u00a9 2015, paizo inc.; authors: john bennett, logan bonner, robert brookes, jason bulmahn, ross byers, john compton, adam daigle, jim groves, thurston hillman, eric hindley, brandon hodge, ben mcfarland, erik mona, jason nelson, tom phillips, stephen radney-macfarland, thomas m. reid, alex riggs, robert schwalb, mark seifter, russ taylor, and steve townshend."

progenitors, they are often mortified to discover terrifying and debilitating alterations to their physique. while the call seizes the changelings' minds around the time their bodies begin maturing, the arcane malignancies that mar their features and extremities have nothing to do with puberty.not every changeling develops a malignancy, and when a changeling does develop a malignancy, it is often unrelated to whatever traits her hag mother has. these transformations are more akin to a magical allergy, manifesting in response to the well of arcane energy bubbling away in the changeling's core.a changeling character can take an arcane malignancy as a drawback in order to select an additional trait at character creation. randomly determine the arcane malignancy by rolling a d% and consulting the table below.   table: arcane malignancies  d%effect1\u20132the smallest three toes on each of your feet have fused together. you take a \u20132 penalty on acrobatics, climb, and perform (dance) checks.3\u20134your incisors grow so long and sharp that you have difficulty eating. eating takes twice as long. consuming a potion or other magical foodstuff requires a full-round action.5\u20137you have an extra digit on each hand, which hampers your fine motor skills. you take a \u20132 penalty on craft, disable device, and sleight of hand checks.8\u201310your limbs and torso are covered with piscine scales that you must constantly moisten. if more than 1 day passes without you applying at least a gallon of water to them, you take 1d3 points of damage each hour until you do so.11\u201313your skin bears a sizable scarlet mark that flushes and lightens with your moods. you take a \u20132 penalty on bluff and disguise checks.14\u201316one of your eyes has grown enlarged and developed a pale, milky film. daylight seems uncomfortably bright to you. you take a \u20132 penalty on saving throws against light-based spells and effects, and you are automatically dazzled for 1d6 rounds when exposed to bright light or sunlight.17\u201319the soles of your feet are flat, and you tire quickly. you can hustle for only a half hour before becoming fatigued, and every 4 hours spent traveling by foot in a day deals 1 point of constitution damage.20\u201322your already pallid complexion grows unusually sensitive to the rays of the sun. exposure to direct sunlight for more than 1 hour at a time makes you sickened for 24 hours.23\u201325the tip of your tongue is forked and stiff. you have difficulty making yourself understood. you take a \u20132 penalty on bluff, diplomacy, and disguise checks to fool or persuade others.26\u201328the painful and stiff swelling of your joints puts you at a disadvantage in combat. you take a \u20132 penalty on combat maneuver checks and escape artist checks to free yourself when grappled or pinned.29\u201331your ears have stretched to an abnormal size, making you overly sensitive to loud noises. whenever you are dealt sonic damage, you take 1 additional point of damage, and you are deafened for 1 minute whenever you take damage from any sonic effect.32\u201333the pupils of your eyes resemble a cat's, and beasts cannot abide your presence. you take a \u20132 penalty on handle animal and ride checks.34\u201335you grow velvety-soft fur along your back, arms, and legs that chafes and catches under clothing and armor, increasing the armor check penalty of any armor by 1 and applying a \u20131 armor check penalty to ordinary clothing. clothing and armor can be specially fitted for you, eliminating the increased penalty but increasing their price by 50 gp.36\u201337you grow an extra row of sharp, crooked teeth. the uneven set of your jaws gives you constant headaches. you take a \u20132 penalty on concentration checks and saving throws against pain effects.38\u201340it is nearly impossible to find armor that fits your concave chest and unusually narrow, sloping shoulders. the armor check penalty of any armor you wear increases by 1, and you take a \u20131 penalty to ac when wearing medium or heavy armor.41\u201342your throat balloons out like a frog's, and your voice comes out as an odd croak. you take a \u20132 penalty on diplomacy checks and on perform (act, oratory, and sing) checks.43\u201345an oozing sore has developed on your face that refuses to heal and makes you more susceptible to illness. you take a \u20132 penalty on saving throws against disease.46\u201348your flesh grows bark, and your major joints have become gnarled and knotted like tree limbs, causing you to move slowly and stiffly. you take a \u20132 penalty on reflex saves.49\u201351your thin, almost translucent skin is delicate and tears easily. you take 1 point of bleed damage from slashing attacks that deal at least 1 point of damage to you.52\u201354a massive patch of multicolored warts covers much of your face. people cannot help but stare, and they always remember you once they've seen you. you take a \u20134 penalty on disguise checks.55\u201357your unruly hair grows with alarming speed. if you do not spend 1 hour trimming and grooming your hair every 48 hours, it snarls in nearby foliage whenever you are outdoors, imposing a \u20132 penalty to your armor class and on attack rolls and stealth checks.58\u201360your limbs are thin and frail. you take a \u20132 penalty to cmd against disarm, grapple, and trip attempts.61\u201363your bones shatter as easily as glass. you take 2 additional points of damage each time you are hit by an attack made with a bludgeoning weapon.64\u201365one arm is turning to stone, though you retain limited mobility. you take a \u20134 penalty on all skill checks requiring the use of two hands and on attack rolls when wielding a two-handed weapon or fighting with two weapons.66\u201367you develop an allergy to one spell per spell level from the witch spell list (determined by your gm). casting or being the target of a spell you're allergic to causes you to break out in a painful rash. this rash deals 1d4 points of damage per spell level, and imposes a penalty on your charisma equal to the level of the spell. the rash fades after a number of hours equal to the level of the spell.68\u201369the joints in your unnaturally long thumbs have fused, and you often fumble objects. when you retrieve a stored item, you have a 10% chance of dropping it.70\u201372your knees bend backward like a bird's, which makes many athletic movements difficult to master. you take a \u20132 penalty on climb and swim checks, and your running speed is only three times your regular walking speed.73\u201375a tenacious patch of fungus has sprouted on your back, weakening your system against toxins. you take a \u20132 penalty on saves against poison effects.76\u201377your misaligned eyes affect your ability to judge distances. you take a \u20132 penalty on ranged attack and damage rolls.78\u201380when you get flustered, heat builds up in your face until it glows with inner fire. you take a \u20134 penalty on diplomacy and perform checks when in the presence of 5 or more creatures.81\u201383your ears curl up like dried leaves, and you experience difficulty picking up sounds. you take a \u20132 penalty on hearing-based perception checks.84\u201386your curving, clawlike fingernails grow so long so quickly that they impede you in dangerous situations. you take a \u20132 penalty on escape artist and sleight of hand checks.87\u201389one of your legs measures noticeably longer than the other, and you lose your balance easily. you take a \u20132 penalty to cmd against bull rush and trip attempts.90\u201392your eyes have swollen to mere slits. you take a \u20132 penalty on sight-based perception checks.93\u201396you develop a shaggy pelt about your neck and shoulders that makes you overheat quickly. you take a \u20134 penalty on checks and saves to resist environmental heat effects.97\u201398you grow a tail that you can't easily conceal and that thrashes violently at inconvenient moments. you take a \u20132 penalty on disguise and stealth checks.99\u2013100you grow vestigial gills. while they grant you no ability to breathe in water, they make it harder for you to catch your breath. when you are fatigued, it takes 12 hours of complete rest to recover. when you are exhausted, it takes 2 hours of complete rest to become fatigued.section 15:

    "description": "This spell charges your hand with telekinetic force. your successful melee touch attack deals 1d4 points of force damage per level (maximum 10d4) and causes the target to be pushed away from you in a straight line up to 5 feet per two caster levels. for every size category of the target above medium, reduce the distance pushed by 5 feet (\u20135 feet for large, \u201310 feet for huge, \u201315 for gargantuan, and \u201320 feet for colossal) to a minimum of 0 feet. a successful fortitude save negates the movement but not the damage.mythic force punchthe damage dealt increases to 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). if moving the target would push it into another creature's space and it has at least 10 feet of distance remaining, you can attempt to overrun the other creature, adding your tier on the combat maneuver check. for each creature you overrun with the target, reduce the distance the target moves by 5 feet. if moving the target would push it into a solid obstacle (such as a wall or tree), the target takes damage as if it had fallen the distance pushed.augmented (3rd): if you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast this spell as a ranged touch attack with a range of close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels), and the target is treated as two size categories smaller for the purpose of determining the total distance pushed.section 15: copyright noticepathfinder roleplaying game: ultimate magic. \u00a9 2011, paizo publishing, llc; authors: jason bulmahn, tim hitchcock, colin mccomb, rob mccreary, jason nelson, stephen radney-macfarland, sean k reynolds, owen k.c. stephens, and russ taylor.pathfinder roleplaying game mythic adventures \u00a9 2013, paizo publishing, llc; authors: jason bulmahn, stephen radney-macfarland, sean k reynolds, dennis baker, jesse benner, ben bruck, jim groves, tim hitchcock, tracy hurley, jonathan keith, jason nelson, tom phillips, ryan macklin, f. wesley schneider, amber scott, tork shaw, russ taylor, and ray vallese."

    "description": "Casting a gate spell has two effects.first, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate.the gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). it is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.a gate has a front and a back. creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.planar travel: as a mode of planar travel, a gate spell functions much like a plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. travelers need not join hands with you\u2013anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. a gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.you may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.calling creatures: the second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). by naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. this use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. this use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. this cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures.if you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. in either case, their total hd cannot exceed twice your caster level. in the case of a single creature, you can control it if its hd does not exceed your caster level. a creature with more hd than your caster level can't be controlled. deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. an uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. an uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.if you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. the service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. some creatures may want their payment in \u201clivestock\u201d rather than in coin, which could involve complications. immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. after this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. at worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.note: when you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type."

the magnitude of the penalty or bonus depends upon how closely that particular card's alignment matches the target creature's alignment. if the card and target's alignments are identical, that card provides a +2 luck bonus on the associated suit's check. if the card and target's alignments are of the opposite alignment (see below), the card inflicts a \u20131 penalty on that associated check. if the card has any other alignment, it provides a +1 luck bonus on the associated suit's check.while penalties persist on all associated checks for as long as the harrowing persists, the bonuses are one-use bonuses that the harrowed character can \u201cspend\u201d at any time to modify that card's associated check. you can spend a bonus to modify an appropriate roll after the die is rolled, but cannot spend the bonus once you know the result of the roll. since all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing are luck bonuses, they do not stack with each other. penalties, on the other hand, do stack. once you spend all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing, or once the spell's duration ends, the spell ends and the penalties are removed.a single creature can only be under the effects of one harrowing at a time. if it is subjected to a second harrowing while a previous harrowing is still in effect, the new harrowing automatically fails.associated suit checkssuitassociated checkhammer (str)attack rolls (ranged and melee)key (dex)reflex saving throwsshield (con)fortitude saving throwsbook (int)skill checksstar (wis)will saving throwscrown (cha)any d20 rollopposition alignmentsalignmentoppositionlgcengnecglelncnnlg, le, cg, or ce (pick one when spell is cast)cnlnlecgnengcelgharrowing, greaterschool divination;

    "description": "You create a dark whip-shaped field of energy that wraps around an enemy's neck, leaving everything except his head paralyzed until you let go of the whip or it is destroyed.you must make a ranged touch attack with this spell. if you strike your target, he takes a 1d6 penalty to his strength, dexterity, and constitution each round. this penalty cannot reduce any attribute to less than 1, and once any of these attributes reaches 1 the target collapses and his body, except his head, becomes paralyzed. while paralyzed in this way, the target retains full use of his senses, including the ability to feel pain, and can speak (including casting spells with only verbal components). the whip has a maximum length of 20 feet, 15 hit points, and a hardness of 5. the spell ends immediately if you let go of the whip or it is destroyed. when the spell ends, all penalties the target took from this spell also end. faq  how does this spell work?limp lash suffers a bit from using game terms as general descriptive text. here are some clarifications.1. you strike the target with the whip, he start taking ability penalties, is he paralyzed or hindered in any other way?he is not paralyzed until the ability penalty reduces the victim's effective strength, dexterity, or constitution to 1 (the minimum to which this spell can adjust a score). once one of these 3 scores is reduced to 1, the victim becomes paralyzed\u2014he is not paralyzed before this point.2. the whip has a maximum range of 20 ft. if the target is not paralyzed or otherwise prevented from moving, what happens when he moves out of the 20 ft range? the spell dissipates or\u2026?if the target moves out of range, the spell ends. (this is similar to what happens if you let go of the whip.) this does mean it's relatively easy for a victim to escape from the spell\u2014that is by design, since otherwise the fact that there's no save to resist the penalties is pretty powerful.3. can you take any actions while holding the whip?you can take any action you want, but if any action requires you to release your hold on the whip, the limp lash spell immediately ends.4. what happens if some effect attempts to displace the whip (e.g. wall of stone between you and the target), or some effect moves the target away (e.g. bull rush)?the spell effect ends if something moves the target out of range or completely breaks the line of effect between you and the target.[source]"

    "description": "The target of this spell gains no benefit from normal or magical sleep, writhing in a series of nightmares that torture its psyche and diminish its ability to perform strenuous tasks. the target doesn't heal ability or hit point damage naturally and can't prepare spells or regain spell slots. after one night of poor sleep, the target is fatigued (or exhausted if it was fatigued before trying to rest). a creature affected by this spell doesn't recover from the fatigued or exhausted condition inflicted by this spell after resting, nor do spells such as lesser restoration provide any respite. each restless night, the target takes 1d4 points of wisdom damage, which also can't be recovered by magic while night terrors is active.the images from previous nightmares continue to haunt the target's mind while awake. if the target has rested at least once while affected by night terrors and then becomes subjected to a fear condition, the target experiences the next higher level of fear than it would normally. however, per the alternate rules for fear, this spell cannot cause a lesser state of fear to become a greater one. if the effect causing the fear condition doesn't usually stack with other fear effects, the target's level of fear does not increase. this aspect of the spell is a fear effect.the affected creature can attempt a new saving throw once per day to end night terrors, but multiple attempts to rest in a given day do not afford the target multiple saves. a creature that successfully saves against night terrors ends the spell and rests normally that night but gains the benefits of only that night's rest, not any benefits missed on previous nights.if your campaign uses the sanity rules, the target takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of wisdom damage.section 15: copyright noticepathfinder roleplaying game horror adventures \u00a9 2016, paizo inc.; authors: john bennett, clinton j. boomer, logan bonner, robert brookes, jason bulmahn, ross byers, jim groves, steven helt, thurston hillman, eric hindley, brandon hodge, mikko kallio, jason nelson, tom phillips, stephen radney-macfarland, alistair rigg, alex riggs, david n. ross, f. wesley schneider, david schwartz, mark seifter, and linda zayas-palmer."

    "description": "This spell helps creatures accustomed to the concrete reality of the material plane to navigate within the confusing realities of other planes. when cast, it functions as know direction, save that instead of revealing true north, it reveals the direction of the palace or demesnes most associated with that plane or demiplane's ruling god or demigod, as well as a brief and generic vision of that entity's appearance or holy symbol. the spell functions only within whatever plane or demiplane you are located in at the time; for instance, if cast within a specific demon lord's abyssal realm or on a given layer of hell, it would point to the seat of power for that demon lord or archdevil. if a plane or demiplane has multiple gods or rulers, it reveals the directions of the closest three, allowing for triangulation.this spell reveals the location of the god or demigod's official seat of power only, not the entity itself, and if such a location is deliberately hidden via magic of any sort, the spell automatically fails. it does not function on the material plane.section 15: copyright noticepathfinder campaign setting: the first world, realm of the fey \u00a9 2016, paizo inc.; author: james l. sutter."

    "description": "With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than 1 week before the casting of the spell and the subject's soul is free and willing to return. if the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. the condition of the remains is not a factor. so long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. the magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. this process takes 1 hour to complete. when the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.a reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. it retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. strength, dexterity, and constitution scores depend partly on the new body. first eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. the subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. if the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its con to 0 or less, it can't be reincarnated). a character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. a spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.it's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. if this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.for a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table below. for non-humanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.a creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell. constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. the spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age.the reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn't automatically speak the language of the new form.a wish or a miracle spell can restore a reincarnated character to his or her original form.\r   official \r

    "description": "This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. when triggered, a symbol of death kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. the symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. a creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. a creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). to be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.as a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed.in this case, \u201creading\u201d the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. you can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.you can also set special triggering limitations of your own. these can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. intangibles such as level, class, hd, and hit points don't qualify.when scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol's effect. anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. if the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.you also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. you are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.read magic allows you to identify a symbol with a spellcraft check (dc 10 + the symbol's spell level). of course, if the symbol is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.a symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. an erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death. destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it."

(if the compelled action is against the victim's nature, he immediately gains a new saving throw at a +5 bonus against the spell to end its effects.) for the next hour, the target acts as you dictated, doing all he can to fulfill your command. if, at the end of the hour, the target still has not completed your command, the target is released from the enchantment and the spell ends. once the course of action is completed, the spell ends. the target has full memory of acts performed during this hour.it's difficult to detect an unconscious agenda before the spell is triggered. casting detect magic on one affected by it only reveals an aura of enchantment if the caster of detect magic has a higher caster level then the caster of unconscious agenda. even if the spell is detected, it can only be removed by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish. dispel magic does not affect unconscious agenda.section 15: copyright noticepathfinder adventure path: rise of the runelords anniversary edition \u00a9 2012, paizo publishing, llc; authors: wolfgang baur, stephen s. greer, james jacobs, nicolas logue, richard pett, and greg a. vaughan."

    "description": "This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. a wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. you can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. the wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. the wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. it can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. for this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. this requirement reduces the spell's area by half. the wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenelations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. a section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. if a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the dc for the strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.it is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. creatures can avoid entrapment with successful reflex saves."

    "description": "A wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's finger. any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes piercing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's ac. dexterity and dodge bonuses to ac do not count for this calculation. (creatures with an ac of 25 or higher, without considering dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)you can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. this has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a strength check as a full-round action. for every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. a creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. in order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage.a wall of thorns can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes."

(the wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment, at the gm's discretion.)duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save dcs are for 9th-level spells).when a wish duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 25,000 gp diamond component for this spell)."

    "description": "You cause any sort of natural terrain (including water, forest, desert, tundra, and so on) to surge beneath your feet and safely propel you with devastating force over great distances. this wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. when you cast the spell you must choose the wave's type, either a tsunami or a swell. if you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. if you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. you can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. you can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave.when you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. once you make this decision, you cannot change it. the wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. however, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell).the wave damages any manufactured object or structure. on the material plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the gm's discretion.the wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. you cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. if the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave's crest. in such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that.the momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city).you can only create the wave if standing on the ground. you cannot create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate.section 15: copyright noticeadvanced player's guide. copyright 2010, paizo publishing, llc; author: jason bulmahn."

    "description": "The daggers serving as focus of this spell take on a deadly sharpness as they animate and spin around you, creating a 5-foot-radius emanation of spinning mithral blades that moves with you. any creature that starts its turn within the area of the spinning blades takes 1d4 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d4 at 20th level) and the damage bypasses dr/silver. furthermore, the daggers ward off some attacks, in a way similar to the warding weapon spell. while subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells, even from creatures with the disruptive feat. creatures with the spellbreaker feat can easily bypass this defensive property, though they still take damage from the spell. your casting (even failing to cast defensively) still provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures with that feat. lastly, the blades that serve as the focus for this spell can be enchanted for greater effect. when all of the blades share the same enhancement bonus and special weapon qualities, a creature that is damaged by this spell is also treated as if hit by one of these weapons. for example, if a 12th-level magus casts this spell using four +1 frost mithral daggers as focus, the damage dealt by the blades would be 6d4+1 plus 1d6 cold damage, as long as the daggers were commanded to be sheathed in ice. no matter the modifications made to the focus weapons, they must always be mithral daggers. no other type of weapons can serve as a focus for this spell.section 15: copyright noticepathfinder roleplaying game ultimate combat. \u00a9 2011, paizo publishing, llc; authors: jason bulmahn, tim hitchcock, colin mccomb, rob mccreary, jason nelson, stephen radney-macfarland, sean k reynolds, owen k.c. stephens, and russ taylor."
