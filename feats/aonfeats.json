You can gain this feat multiple times, each time selecting a different agony, but you can perform an obedience for only a single agony in a 24-hour period. Each agony requires a different obedience, but all obediences take only an hour to perform. Once the obedience has been performed, you take a number of minor penalties and gain the benefit of a resistance to some element or attack associated with your agony, as indicated below. Additionally, you gain the ability to make an agony strike. A number of times per day equal to 1 + 1 per every 5 Hit Dice you possess, when you deal damage to a creature, you can declare that attack as an agony strike. In addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack, you cause the target to take the penalties associated with your agony for 1 minute. Incorporeal creatures and creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to agony strikes.  If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by your agony upon undertaking your obedience. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you gain the agony\u2019s second boon as well. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the agony\u2019s third boon. Unless a specific duration or number of uses per day is listed, a boon\u2019s effects are constant.  If you ever fail to perform a daily obedience, or if you are healed of damage, conditions, or penalties caused in the course of performing your obedience, you lose all access to resistances and boons granted by this feat until you next perform the obedience.  Amputation  You have amputated a digit on one of your hands and treated the wound such that it will never fully heal.   Obedience : Manipulate the scabs, scar tissue, and open wound of your amputated digit, preventing it from closing and forcing bits of metal and glass into the wound. Take a \u20132 penalty on Disable Device, Disguise, Escape Artist, and Sleight of Hand skill checks, as well as to your CMD against disarm maneuvers. When attempting to cast a spell with somatic components, succeed at a caster level check whose DC is equal to 5 + twice the spell level or lose the spell slot with no effect. Gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against transmutation spells; this bonus increases to +4 against spells in the polymorph subschool.   Boon 1 : In addition to the normal effects of your agony strike, the target has a chance of dropping one object held in its hand immediately after you hit it with the agony strike. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Dexterity modifier) avoids this effect.   Boon 2 : You gain the use of a phantom arm, which functions as the vestigial arm alchemist discovery ( Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic  18) save that it is an invisible force effect, it does not grant an additional ring magic item slot, and it cannot make attacks.   Boon 3 : You are immune to effects that would cause you to become sickened, and you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against any conditions that would make you nauseated.  Blinding  You temporarily blind yourself with blood to heighten your other senses.   Obedience : Scratch at your eyes with your fingernails, jagged metal shavings, and thorny branches, allowing the blood from your wounds to form thick scabs over your eyelids and tear ducts. Take a \u20134 penalty on visionbased Perception checks, and anytime you make an attack against a target benefiting from concealment, increase the miss chance by 10% (maximum 50%). Gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against illusions in the pattern subschool and against gaze attacks.   Boon 1 : Creatures affected by your agony strike have the distance they can see in areas of dim light and darkness reduced by 50%.   Boon 2 : You gain a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet that you can activate as a standard action. You can use this ability a number of minutes per day equal to half your hit dice; these minutes need not be consecutive but you must use the ability in 1-minute increments. Enemies affected by your gaze are frightened for 1 minute. A successful Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Charisma modifier) negates this effect. A creature that successfully saves against your gaze is immune to its effects for 24 hours.   Boon 3 : Your affinity to pain allows you to sense suffering in others. You gain lifesense out to a distance of 60 feet.  Flensing  Practitioners of the agony of flensing are adept at finely removing the skin from living flesh, revealing the vulnerable tissue beneath.   Obedience : Remove a patch of your own skin measuring at least 3 square inches with a flensing knife, while carefully avoiding damage to the muscles, veins, and other tissues underneath. Leave this patch of exposed nerves uncovered by clothing or armor, allowing it to be exposed to the elements and displaying your sacrifice to all you meet. Take a \u20132 penalty on saving throws against disease, and take 1 extra point of damage per die from sneak attacks. Gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against pain effects.   Boon 1 : All attacks you make against a creature suffering the effects of your agony strike deal 1d6 points of bleed damage.   Boon 2 : Your knowledge of anatomy imparts to you an awareness of others\u2019 vulnerabilities. You gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls to confirm critical hits.   Boon 3 : The frequent removal of skin and subsequent healing has covered your body in thick scars. Your natural armor bonus to AC increases by 2. Additionally, there is a 25% chance that critical hits and sneak attacks fail to affect you, as though you were wearing armor with the  light fortification  property.",

Specific cultures and their rituals are listed below.  If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by your lost culture upon undertaking its daily ritual. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the lost culture\u2019s second boon. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the lost culture\u2019s third boon. Each boon is a spell-like ability that you can cast once per day. Your caster level for these boons is equal to your Hit Dice, and the saving throw DC is based on your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest).  For the purposes of this feat, you are considered to have a connection to a lost culture if you have a relic or object from that civilization, have extensively researched that culture, or are descended\u2014directly or culturally\u2014from that culture\u2019s people. Once you have chosen a lost culture, you cannot change it without your GM\u2019s permission. At the GM\u2019s discretion, other types of connections might also apply. Typically, you can have a connection to only one lost civilization. If you ever fail to perform a daily ritual, you lose all access to the benefits and boons granted by this feat until the time you next perform the daily ritual.   Lost Cultures  The following cultures have rich ancient traditions in which characters can invest.   Ancient Osirion  Founded by Azghaad, a prophet of Nethys who famously slew a Spawn of Rovagug and founded his capital within its carapace, Osirion is a nation with a long and proud history. The Ancient Osirians are best known today for their elaborate tombs, many of which have remained untouched for millennia.   Daily Ritual : Position yourself where you can watch the sun rise. As it does, briefly give thanks to each god in Ancient Osirion\u2019s pantheon. Reflect on your notable Osirian ancestors or other ancient heroes and their accomplishments. Then, leave a small offering of cooked food on a wooden plate (or, if none is available, on a large leaf ). You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist death effects.   Boons : 1:  sepia snake sigil ; 2:  elemental body IV ; 3:  mage\u2019s disjunction .   Azlant  Azlant is considered by many to have been the pinnacle of human society, though the ancient empire\u2019s hubris brought about the calamity known as Earthfall.   Daily Ritual : Stand tall, with one arm outstretched, clutching a crystal, gem, or  ioun stone  in your fist. Keeping your arm outstretched, slowly turn three times in a counterclockwise circle, each time naming aloud one of your achievements or strengths. You gain a +2 bonus on Spellcraft and Use Magic Device checks.   Boons : 1:  arcane sight ; 2:  reverse gravity ; 3:  overwhelming presence .   Jistka Imperium  One of the first human civilizations to emerge after the devastation of Earthfall, Jistka was known for its advanced technologies and mighty legions. The Imperium eventually fell before the rising might of Ancient Osirion and the Tekritanin League.   Daily Ritual : Read sections from the Poleiheira, the journals of Arustun, the ancient hero who founded the Jistka Imperium. If you do not have any portions of these journals, you can instead meditate on the nature of civilization, the importance of structure and discipline to society, and the ways in which technology can improve the lives of the people. You gain a +1 bonus on damage rolls for nonmagical masterwork weapons and a +2 bonus on Craft checks to create golems.   Boons : 1:  keen edge ; 2:  control construct ; 3:  wooden phalanx .   Lung Wa  While not the largest empire in its region\u2019s history, Lung Wa was perhaps the most prosperous\u2014and certainly the most recent, collapsing only about a century ago. The empire\u2019s reign is noted for its long periods of peace and stability, along with its state religion, which raised emperors to deities and banned the worship of other divine figures.   Daily Ritual : Carefully write your name in calligraphy in the center of a blank piece of parchment. Then, write around it the names of those to whom you have obligations: your family members, superiors, dependents, business partners, neighbors, and so on, mapping the personal connections in a wheel about yourself. If no paper is available, the writing can be performed in a patch of smooth sand or earth instead. You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist emotion effects.   Boons : 1:  tongues ; 2:  form of the dragon I ; 3:  resplendent mansion .   Ninshabur  Situated around the Pit of Gormuz, the nation of Ninshabur boasted a warlike people, whose phalanxes spread far and wide to lay siege to other nations. Though their armies are said to have successfully done battle against the Spawn of Rovagug on many occasions, they met their end facing the wicked Tarrasque.   Daily Ritual : Recall a battle with a magical beast you participated in that occurred within the last week. Meditate on your technique and identify ways to improve for your next combat. If you have not fought a magical beast recently, instead train for 1 hour, chanting the war cries of Ninshabur while you do. You gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls against magical beasts.   Boons : 1:  monstrous physique I ; 2:  regenerate ; 3:  symbol of strife .   Sarkoris  The land that was once Sarkoris has always been unpredictable and wild\u2014a place where borders between planes were naturally thin and whose ties to other planes of existence long predated the formation of the Worldwound. Before this land was invaded by demons and scoured of human life, it was home to a proud warrior culture ruled over by shamans. Daily Ritual : With your back to the rising sun, travel directly westward (or as close to directly westward as you can manage). At the first signs of an animal you encounter, you must change your path to track it, and if you are able to catch up to it within an hour, you must attempt to slay or capture it. You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (planes) and Survival checks.   Boons : 1:  summon nature\u2019s ally III ; 2:  fairy ring retreat ; 3:  gate .   Shory  The aerial Shory Empire consisted of a collection of loosely aligned city-states that soared through the skies with the power of Shory\u2019s advanced aeromancy techniques.   Daily Ritual : Climb to the highest point available to you, where you have a clear and unobstructed view of the sky. If you are able to fly, you should fly as high as you reasonably can instead. Spread your arms wide and reflect on the openness and freedom of the skies, and the power of flight. Speak a blessing to each of the four winds and ask that they bring only good fortune your way this day. You gain a +2 bonus on Fly checks and treat your caster level as 1 higher when determining the duration of spells you cast with the air descriptor. Boons : 1:  fly ; 2:  wind walk ; 3:  winds of vengeance .  Tar Taargadth  The dwarven empire of Tar Taargadth was the final product of the dwarves who undertook the Quest for Sky. The empire represented both the perseverance and the unity of the dwarves in ancient days.   Daily Ritual : Dig a hole that is at least 1 foot deep. Gather the dug up earth and create a small mound. Sit on the mound and meditate on the Quest for Sky. Reflect both on the life for those underground and the liberation granted to those above ground. Write a short prayer and bury it in the hole, covering it with the same earth. You gain a +2 bonus on Survival checks while underground and a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves.   Boons : 1:  meld with stone ; 2:  rampart ; 3:  clashing rocks .   Thassilon  Ruled over by powerful mages and built on the backs of enslaved giants, Thassilon was one of the great powers of the ancient world.   Daily Ritual : Meditate on an action you performed the previous day that particularly corresponds with one of the seven sins celebrated by Thassilonian rune magic. If you cannot think of any sinful actions you performed the previous day, you are unable to complete the ritual. Once your meditation is complete, draw the rune corresponding to the chosen sin in a prominent place on your body, such as the palm, the back of the hand, the forehead, or the chest. Choose a school of magic from the following list: abjuration, conjuration, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, or transmutation. Once you choose a school of magic, it cannot be changed. You gain a +2 bonus on saves against spells of the chosen school.   Boons : 1:  explosive runes ; 2:  symbol of stunning ; 3:  symbol of vulnerability . ",

    "benefit": "Immediately before casting a spell, as a swift action, you can attempt to augment a spell\u2019s casting using Arithmancy. To do so, determine the digital root of the name of the spell you are casting.  To find the digital root of a spell name, first assign a numerical value to each letter of the name, per the Letter Values table. Once you have a string of digits, sum them.   Numerical Value Associated Letters   1 a, j, s   2 b, k, t   3 c, l, u   4 d, m, v   5 e, n, w   6 f, o, x   7 g, p, y   8 h, q, z   9 i, r  If the result has more than one digit, sum those digits. Repeat this process until you arrive at a single number, called the digital root.  Once you\u2019ve translated the name of the spell into a single digital root, attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell level + the digital root. If your check succeeds, the spell is cast at +1 caster level. If your check fails, the spell is cast at \u20131 caster level. If you do not cast the spell you intended to augment with arithmancy, the spell is expended with no effect, though you retain the action you would have spent to cast it. Metamagic effects are not included in a spell\u2019s name when determining the spell\u2019s digital root, but they increase the spell\u2019s level as normal when determining the DC of the Spellcraft check.  You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to the number of caster levels you possess.  For example, Ezren wants to use Arithmancy to cast an augmented  fireball . First, he translates the spell name into numbers.  Fireball  translates to 6, 9, 9, 5, 2, 1, 3, 3. Then he calculates the digital root. In this case, 6 + 9 + 9 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 38, 3 + 8 = 11, and 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the digital root of  fireball  is 2. He then attempts a Spellcraft check against a DC of 15 (10 + 3 [ fireball \u2019s spell level] + 2 [ fireball \u2019s digital root]). If his check succeeds, he can cast the fireball this round at +1 caster level. If he fails, he can cast the spell at \u20131 caster level this round. He may also choose not to cast  fireball  and perform another action, though he expends the spell.",

    "special": "You can gain Armor Trick multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new armor trick option.  Heavy Armor Tricks Source   Armor Master's Handbook pg. 9 These armor tricks are most common among the various Hellknight orders, though their secrets have spread to other organizations and fighter schools. Such armor tricks utilize the mass and heft of heavy armor, and don\u2019t function when you\u2019re wearing heavy armor that uses magic or materials to be treated as medium armor for any purpose, unless the heavy armor trick says otherwise. Blade among the Folds (Sleight of Hand 3 ranks) : You are adept at concealing small weapons in your armor. While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal a light melee weapon or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow, within your armor. In addition, a searcher doesn\u2019t gain the usual +4 bonus on Perception checks to find the hidden weapon as long as you are wearing your armor, even if the searcher frisks you. This trick functions even in heavy armor that uses magic or materials to be treated as medium armor. Protected Limbs (Combat Expertise) : Whenever you attempt a disarm, grapple, sunder, or trip combat maneuver check, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC against any attack of opportunity you provoke as a result of attempting the combat maneuver check, and to your CMD against any combat maneuver your foe attempts against you before the beginning of your next turn. Shrug It Off (Great Fortitude) : Once per day as an immediate action, when you are hit by a confirmed critical hit or sneak attack, you can direct the blow to the thickest section of your armor to lessen the damage dealt. This reduces the attack to dealing its minimum damage, though it remains a successful critical hit or sneak attack (the minimum damage calculated includes all additional dice for the critical hit or sneak attack, and any abilities that apply due to it being a critical hit or sneak attack function normally). You can use this ability a second time each day when your base attack bonus reaches +4, and an additional time per day for every 4 points of bonus you accrue thereafter. Steel-Plated Smasher (Power Attack) : You gain a bonus equal to 1/4 of your armor\u2019s armor check penalty (not including any reduction to the armor check penalty from class features or feats) on Strength checks to break doors and objects with less hardness than your armor. When your base attack bonus reaches +8, this bonus increases to 1/2 your armor\u2019s armor check penalty. When your base attack bonus reaches +16, this bonus increases to equal your armor\u2019s full armor check penalty.  Light Armor Tricks Source   Armor Master's Handbook pg. 8 Light armor tricks are rarely taught in formal schools, though some can be learned from experienced Freemen on the streets of Kaer Maga or the leaders of the Bloody Barbers thieves\u2019 guild in Absalom. These armor tricks are often used to supplement the modest defense provided by lighter armors by maximizing flexibility and mobility. Combat Acrobatics (Int 13, Combat Expertise, Acrobatics 3 ranks) : You have trained yourself to expose only armored sections of your body when performing flips and rolls, leaving you less distracted by concerns about being struck in combat. You are not considered flat-footed when using Acrobatics to move on narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling, and do not lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while doing so. Additionally, if you use Combat Expertise to increase your AC, the DC for you to use Acrobatics to move through a threatened square at full speed without provoking an attack of opportunity by 10 does not increase. Reactive Mobility (Mobility, Nimble Moves) : Practice has honed your reactions so that you react quickly and instinctively to threats. You add your dodge bonus granted by Mobility to your AC against all attacks of opportunity that you provoke, not just against those that are caused when you move out of or within a threatened area. Reflexive Mobility (Combat Reflexes, Mobility) : You have learned to sacrifice an opportunity to wound an opponent in order to avoid being wounded yourself. When you provoke an attack of opportunity from an opponent, you can expend one of your own potential attacks of opportunity for that round to double the bonus to your AC that you gain from the Mobility feat against that attack. This benefit applies to all attacks of opportunity that you provoke with the same action. If you are unable to take any more attacks of opportunity this turn, you cannot use this ability. Sliding Charge (Improved Trip, base attack bonus +4) : You can use your momentum to confound your opponents. Whenever you charge an opponent and attempt a trip combat maneuver check against that opponent as a melee attack, you can drop to the ground as a swift action in order to slide into your target. When doing so, you add your Dexterity bonus (up to your armor\u2019s maximum Dexterity bonus) to the combat maneuver check. Whether or not you succeed at the check, you are prone at the end of your charge.  Medium Armor Tricks Source   Armor Master's Handbook pg. 8 Many of these armor tricks originated in Andoran and are employed by various branches of the Eagle Knights, who highly value the greater protection provided by medium armor but want to retain f lexibility and agility in combat. Armor Focus, which is a prerequisite for two of these tricks, can be found on page 16. Acrobatic Sit-Up (Mobility, Acrobatics 5 ranks) : You have developed the ability to recover from a fall and attack an opponent in a single fluid movement. Whenever you are prone, you can make an attack against a single foe and stand from prone without provoking an attack of opportunity from that foe. Make a single melee attack against one target without the normal penalties for attacking while prone. If you hit your target, you can immediately stand from prone (normally a move action) without provoking an attack of opportunity from that target for doing so. Any other target that threatens you can still make an attack of opportunity against you. If your attack fails, you provoke attacks of opportunity from all threatening foes and cannot stand until your next turn. Heavy Versatility (Armor Focus, Armor Trick [Heavy Armor]) : You take advantage of all the defensive capabilities your armor can offer. You can treat medium armor as heavy armor for the purpose of which armor tricks you can perform in it. Light Versatility (Armor Focus, Armor Trick [Light Armor]) : You are so comfortable in your armor that it seems lighter than it is. You can treat medium armor as light armor for the purpose of what armor tricks you can perform in it. Roll into the Blow (Mobility) : You keep your wits about you when attacked and can turn the situation to your advantage. Once per day when you are hit by an attack of opportunity, you can lunge toward your attacker, throwing it off-balance. The attacker takes a \u20134 penalty on all melee attack rolls until the beginning of its next turn. You can use this ability a second time each day when your base attack bonus reaches +4, and an additional time per day for every 4 points of bonus you accrue thereafter. Versatile Armor (Combat Expertise) : You can adjust how you present yourself and maneuver in your armor to maximize your speed and mobility or to maximize your defenses. While using your armor for speed, your movement is not affected by your armor and its armor check penalty and armor bonus to AC both decrease by 2. While using your armor for defense, your armor\u2019s check penalty increases by 3 and its armor bonus to AC increases by 1. Adjusting how you use your armor is a move action, and the adjustment remains until you change it, take off your armor, or lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). Combat Trick  (from the  Combat Stamina  feat) Source   Armor Master's Handbook pg. 20 You can spend 5 stamina points to use an armor trick while wearing armor with which you are not proficient, or without meeting the trick\u2019s additional prerequisites.

You seek to claim the weapon for yourself, either so you may destroy it, use it for your own cruel ends, or simply to weaken the nascent demon lord himself (page 299).  4 Someone has been stealing life-prolonging  sun orchid elixir  from agents of Pashow\u2014and you\u2019re hoping to get a vial for yourself (page 189).  5 The haunted Crypt of Angus Amberleg is said to lie under the jungles of Mediogalti Island and contain the booty from over a hundred raided ships, including Amberleg\u2019s knucklebone of  fickle fortune  (page 115).  6 The dwarven siege engine  Worldbreaker  was lost by Taldor to the Gorilla King of the Mwangi Expanse ages ago, and it possibly still sits in the vaults beneath Usaro (page 183).  7 It is well known that a  deck of many things  was used to construct Castle Everstand in Lastwall. You\u2019re intent on figuring out what happened to the artifact afterward (page 99).  8 A rift to the Shadow Plane in the Nidalese city of Ridwan may be a clue to the whereabouts of the legendary  Shadowstaff  (page 137).  9 You have heard of the fabled wardstones that quarantine the demonic incursion stemming from the Worldwound, and you seek to claim one of these magical menhirs for your own purposes (page 301).  10 The artifacts of ancient Azlant have long piqued your interest, and you are determined to find some of these relics for yourself, even if it means traveling to the sunken continent itself (page 12).  11 You know that the elves used the power of the socalled  Sovyrian Stone  to accomplish a mass exodus from Golarion to their homeland in Sovyrian, but you seek to find this mysterious artifact to realize its powers for yourself (page 94).  12 The elves of the Mordant Spire claim to be the true inheritors of the Azlanti legacy, including that peoples\u2019 famous artifacts\u2014an assertion with which you are at odds (page 181).",

Obvious differences in the value between the exchanged items give your roll a +4 or \u20134 modifier, at the GM\u2019s discretion (offering a clay cup for a jeweled dagger gives your roll a \u20134 penalty). The GM may rule that some items are too obviously valuable or worthless for this feat to apply (a king wouldn\u2019t trade his crown for any item, and no normal person would trade an item for a piece of garbage). If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target is insulted and his attitude toward you worsens by one category. Once the exchange happens, make an Appraise roll opposed by the target\u2019s Appraise or Sense Motive roll. If the target wins, it immediately realizes the true value of the object you offered it and behaves accordingly. If you succeed, it believes your false assessment for 1 round; for every 5 by which your check exceeds your opponent\u2019s check, the deception lasts 1 more round. As with disbelieving illusions, the target\u2019s ally can point out the true value of the object, giving the target another check with a +2 bonus. You cannot use this ability in combat, against a creature whose attitude toward you is hostile or unfriendly, against a creature that does not understand you, or against a creature that has an Intelligence score of 3 or less.",

The figurine has the standard abilities of a familiar or animal companion of its type, plus additional abilities related to its figurine type (see below). The main advantage of this is that if your familiar or companion is killed in creature form, it merely reverts to statue form and can be used again later. The following standard figurines are available as animal companions (C) or familiars (F). Ebony Fly  (C): You must have the Vermin Heart feat (see page 219 of the  Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting ) to select this creature as an animal companion. It is treated as a horse animal companion, and at 8th level it gains a fly speed of 120 feet (average maneuverability). Golden Lions  (C): When you select a  golden lion  as an animal companion, one of the pair becomes your companion and the other retains its standard figurine abilities. Ivory Goats  (C): When selecting an  ivory goat  as an animal companion, you select one of the three goats in the set ( traveling ,  travail , or  terror ) as your companion; the others remain standard figurines. All three goats are treated as horse companions. The goat of traveling never suffers from fatigue or exhaustion from extended travel. The goat of travail has 2 horn attacks (1d8 + Str bonus) in addition to a horse\u2019s normal attacks. The goat of terror has the fear aura and magical weapon horns as described in its figurine entry. Marble Elephant  (C): The elephant is treated as an elephant companion (see page 128 of the  Pathfinder RPG Bestiary ). Serpentine Owl  (C, F): The owl is treated as a bird animal companion or an owl familiar, but only in its Small horned owl form. In its giant owl form, it is merely a creature, not an animal companion or familiar. After three uses of its giant owl form, the figurine loses that transformation ability forever but still functions normally in its horned owl form as an animal companion or familiar. Silver Raven  (C, F): The raven is treated as a bird animal companion or a raven familiar. It retains its metallic appearance and  animal messenger  ability (though this is redundant for an intelligent familiar) but not its hardness when in animal form. While the figurine is active, you and the active figurine gain all the normal benefits of having a companion creature; for example, a wizard with a  silver raven  familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks, the raven can speak one language, and so on. While the figure is inactive, you gain none of these benefits but are not otherwise hampered by its inert state (as if the creature were out of range but not dead). The usable duration of the companion figurine doubles; for example, an  ebony fly  is normally usable up to three times per week for up to 12 hours per use, but as a companion creature you may use it up to six times per week for up to 12 hours per use. The figurine is still a magic item and is subject to effects like  antimagic field  and  dispel magic  that affect magic items; it uses its caster level or your own, whichever is greater. ",

The attempt to hide the spell slows your casting slightly, such that spells that normally take a standard action to cast now take a full-round action, and spells that normally take longer than a standard action take twice as long. (Swift action spells still take a swift action.) To discover your ruse, a creature must succeed at a Perception, Sense Motive, or Spellcraft check (the creature receives an automatic check with whichever of those skills has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Bluff or Disguise (whichever is higher) + your Charisma modifier; the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spelllike ability you are concealing.  If your spell has a somatic component, any creature that can see you receives a Perception or Spellcraft check (whichever has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Sleight of Hand + your Dexterity modifier; the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spell-like ability you are concealing. Since you are concealing the spell\u2019s manifestation through other actions, others observing you realize you\u2019re doing something, even if they don\u2019t realize you\u2019re casting a spell. If there is a verbal component, they still hear your loud, clear voice but don\u2019t notice the spell woven within. If an opponent fails its check, your casting also does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and an opponent that fails its check can\u2019t use readied actions that depend on realizing that you\u2019re casting a spell or using a spell-like ability, or readied actions such as counterspelling that require identifying the spell you\u2019re casting. Spells such as  fireball  that create an additional obvious effect (aside from the manifestation of casting that all spells and spell-like abilities share) still create that effect, though it might not be obvious who cast the spell unless it emanates from you.  If a character interacts with you long enough to attempt a Sense Motive check without realizing you have been casting spells, that character can use Sense Motive to gain a hunch that you\u2019re behaving unusually.

Both you and the recipient of the piercing (if not yourself) must be present for the entire piercing process.  Shadow piercings must be placed in a part of the body normally associated with a magic item slot, but they do not take up a slot on the body, nor interfere with other magic items that use those slots. A single slot can only hold one shadow piercing (nonmagical piercings do not count against this limit). Shadow piercings can be applied to the following slots: belt, body, chest, eyes, feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, and wrist.  A single slot can hold multiple physical piercings, though the pieces of jewelry operate as a single item and must be created for that purpose. Shadow piercings have different levels of power: minor, major, and greater. Minor shadow piercings usually include one piece of jewelry, while major and greater shadow piercings often are made up of multiple rings and spikes that cover the entire area of the piercing\u2019s slot (but are still considered a single item). A creature can only use a number of shadow piercings equal its Constitution modifier plus its Wisdom modifier.  Carefully inserting or removing a shadow piercing takes a full-round action and deals no damage. Alternatively, a shadow piercing may be pulled out of a creature using the steal maneuver as a standard action that deals 1d6 points of damage. Only a creature with the Craft Shadow Piercing feat may create or insert a shadow piercing, but any creature may remove one. Inserting a shadow piercing is impossible unless the target is willing or helpless. After being removed, a shadow piercing may be inserted into another creature by someone with this feat. Since they are treated as magic items, they are affected by  dispel magic .  Shadow piercings follow the rules for magic item creation, except the creator can use the Craft (jewelry) skill instead of Spellcraft. New shadow piercings can be researched and designed using the rules for pricing new magic items. Shadow piercing powers for a specific slot must be thematically similar or linked. Since shadow piercings don\u2019t interfere with other magic items in the same slot, but can only have one piercing per slot, the base price is multiplied by 1.5 instead of doubled as if they had no space limitation.",

    "benefit": "When you craft an item using your Craft skill, you can pay 1/5 of the item\u2019s price for the raw material cost and craft a shoddy item (see page 116). You must still succeed at the appropriate DC check, and the work takes the same amount of time as a normal item. If you fail the Craft check by 5 or more, you ruin all the raw materials and must begin again. If you attempt to craft an item of even lower quality, the item\u2019s poor quality is immediately apparent. Normal : You pay 1/3 of the item\u2019s price for the raw material cost. If you fail the Craft check by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and must pay half the original raw material cost again.  Shoddy Item Price  varies;  Weight  varies  A shoddy item is any mundane piece of equipment that has been cleverly but poorly crafted such that its materials and workmanship are worse than expected, but the flaws are concealed. Layers of material are thinner than normal, hasps and hinges are only loosely attached, metals are mixed improperly, resulting in softer alloys, and so forth. Shoddy items are sold for the same price as their well-made counterparts. Manufacturing a shoddy item requires the Craft Shoddy Item feat (see above) in order to successfully conceal the poor workmanship. Shoddy items are never masterwork or made of special materials (though they might appear to be made of a special material), and single-use items can never be made as shoddy items.  Any shoddy item has its hardness reduced by 2 and its hit points reduced by half. Any weapon or piece of armor constructed in a shoddy manner takes damage each time it is used; a weapon takes the same amount of damage it deals in an attack (minus its lower hardness rating), and a piece of armor takes damage identical to its wearer\u2019s loss in hit points from an enemy\u2019s successful attack (again, after taking the adjusted hardness into account). Items other than weapons and armor have a 10% chance to gain the broken condition with each day of use, and if they have a limited number of uses, they have half as many uses as normal. In either case, shoddy items that gain the broken condition can never have that condition removed (even by using magic or if they later recover hit points) without further successful Craft checks and gp expenditure to fix the initial flaws. Shoddy items that are destroyed cannot be recovered by any means, and are useless for anything more than salvaging some of the raw materials. A shoddy item typically costs the same as a normal item of its kind.  A character who succeeds at a DC 15 Appraise (or appropriate Craft) check notices the shoddy condition of an item, but the character must specifically inspect the item to do so.",

Additionally, whenever you would gain a boon as a result of your Deific Obedience feat (and not through a prestige class), you can choose among the options available for evangelist, exalted, or sentinel boons. Once you make the selection, it is permanent, but you can choose from a different category each time you gain a new boon as you increase your Hit Dice. ",

This does not alter the position of you or your opponent, but your opponent must attempt a Reflex save against the attack in your place.

In addition, a warpriest can give up a major blessing to gain the advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.  Abadar's Crossbow Source   Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 10 Abadar teaches complex crossbow techniques. Initial Benefit : You can attempt a ranged steal APG  combat maneuver check with a crossbow, using your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier to calculate your Combat Maneuver Bonus. If you succeed, the stolen item is knocked away by the bolt; if the bolt can pierce any part of the item and the item weighs 2 pounds or less, the bolt continues past the creature and carries the item up to one range increment away, pinning it to whatever surface it lands on. Advanced Prerequisites : Rapid Reload, base attack bonus +10. Advanced Benefit : When fighting a foe adjacent to a firm surface, you can attempt a ranged dirty trick APG  combat maneuver check with a crossbow, using your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier to calculate your Combat Maneuver Bonus. If you succeed, your bolt pins the target\u2019s clothing (or feathers, hide, or the like) to the surface, preventing the target from leaving that space until it breaks free by destroying the bolt or removing it with a successful Strength check (DC = the result of your combat maneuver check to pin it).  Asmodeus\u2019s Mandate Source   Divine Anthology pg. 28 Although soldiers and mercenaries alike in Cheliax claim that the martial techniques detailed within  Wrath and Punishment , the most well-known fighting manual of the Church of Asmodeus, are as old as time itself, martial experts across the Inner Sea region note that  Wrath and Punishment  is less than 3 decades old. Of course, few in Cheliax dare to publicly make such claims. Outside of Cheliax, copies of  Wrath and Punishment  tend to be found in Hellknight enclaves. Initial Benefit : Whenever you threaten a critical hit with a light mace or heavy mace on a foe, that foe becomes sickened for 1 round. If you confirm the critical hit, the sickened effect lasts for 2 rounds. The duration of the sickened effect doesn\u2019t stack with multiple critical threats. Advanced Prerequisites : Int 13; Combat Expertise; Divine Fighting Technique; Improved Feint; base attack bonus +10 or Bluff 10 ranks.  Advanced Benefit : An opponent that you hit with a light mace or heavy mace who is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC is also hindered by the attack. You can attempt a dirty trick APG  combat maneuver check as a swift action that doesn\u2019t provoke an attack of opportunity immediately after damage from the attack is resolved.   Calistria's Poisoned Lash Source   Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 10 Calistria inspires creative ways to poison foes. Optional Replacement : A chaotic neutral rogue or slayer who worships Calistria can replace one talent with the following initial benefit. Initial Benefit : You can apply poison (your choice) to a whip as a move action. You do not risk poisoning yourself when applying poison to a whip. A whip you wield can deliver contact poison upon a successful combat maneuver check as well as upon a successful attack roll, regardless of whether you deal damage. Advanced Prerequisites : Whip Mastery UC , base attack bonus +10. Optional Replacement : A chaotic neutral rogue or slayer who worships Calistria can replace one advanced talent with the following advanced benefit even if she doesn\u2019t meet the prerequisites. Advanced Benefit : You can apply poison to a whip as a swift action. You can apply up to 3 doses of the same poison to a whip at a time. Foes are exposed to only 1 dose of poison from any one attack.  Cayden Cailean's Blade and Tankard Source   Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 11 Cayden Cailean is famous for wading into battle with a tankard in his off hand. Optional Replacement : A chaotic good fighter or swashbuckler who worships Cayden Cailean can replace proficiency with shields or bucklers with the following initial benefit. Initial Benefit : You can wield a tankard (or mug) as a weapon, treating it in all ways as a light mace appropriate for your size. If you engage in two-weapon fighting with a rapier or light weapon in one hand and a tankard in the other, you can drink a potion or other liquid from the tankard or attempt to toss liquid from the tankard as a dirty trick APG  combat maneuver (such as to blind a foe) in place of attacking with it. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity for attempting a dirty trick maneuver with a tankard. Advanced Prerequisites : Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, base attack bonus +10. Optional Replacement : A chaotic good fighter or swashbuckler of at least 10th level who worships Cayden Cailean can replace a bonus feat or deed with the following advanced benefit, even if he doesn\u2019t meet the prerequisites. Advanced Benefit : You can refill your tankard with a beverage, potion, or other liquid from a bottle or vial as a swift action. You gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to perform dirty tricks APG  with tankards. The effects of such a dirty trick lasts for 1d4 rounds + 1 round for every 5 points by which the result of your combat maneuver check exceeds the target\u2019s CMD; a standard action is required for the target to remove this penalty. Desna's Shooting Star Source   Divine Anthology pg. 28 Among the divine fighting manuals of the Inner Sea, few are as ancient as  Clamor of the Spheres , a collection of fighting techniques favored by Desna\u2019s faithful. True to its name, the manual focuses on interpreting the chaos and sounds of combat, but nevertheless provides insightful and downright brilliant methods of defense with Desna\u2019s favored weapon, using techniques that treat a fight with a starknife more as a beautiful dance than a battle. Optional Replacement : A chaotic good bard of at least 2nd level who worships Desna can replace a versatile performance with the following initial benefit. Initial Benefit : You can add your Charisma bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls when wielding a starknife. If you do so, you don\u2019t modify attack rolls and damage rolls with your starknife with your Strength modifier, your Dexterity modifier (if you have Weapon Finesse), or any other ability score (if you have an ability that allows you to modify attack rolls and damage rolls with that ability score).  Advanced Prerequisites : Dex 17; Divine Fighting Technique; Point-Blank Shot; Rapid Shot; base attack bonus +11 or Sleight of Hand 11 ranks. Optional Replacement : A chaotic good bard of at least 10th level who worships Desna can replace a versatile performance with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites. Advanced Benefit : You can impart a powerful spin to a thrown starknife so that multiple blades strike the target rather than just a single blade of the four, dealing extra damage with the other blades. As a full-round action, you can make a single attack with a thrown starknife, rolling 1d4 to determine how many effective strikes you gain with the attack (if you roll a 1, then only one blade strikes). If the attack hits, all of the effective strikes damage the target. Apply precision-based damage (such as sneak attack damage) and critical hit damage only once for this attack. The damage bonus from your appropriate ability score modifier applies to each strike, as do other damage bonuses, such as a bard\u2019s inspire competence bonus. Damage reduction and resistances apply separately to each strike.  Erastil's Distracting Shot Source   Divine Anthology pg. 29 Sometimes used as a companion piece to the  Parables of Erastil , the lesser-known  Horns of the Elk  is a manual completely dedicated to archery. Lacking the folktales that the  Parables  are celebrated for, the  Horns of the Elk  instead focuses on covering a wide array of beginner and advanced archery tactics. A copy of the manual can be found virtually anywhere a shrine to Erastil exists. Optional Replacement : A lawful good ranger who worships Erastil can choose Divine Fighting Technique as the bonus feat granted by his combat style if he chooses archery as his combat style. Initial Benefit : As a standard action, you can fire a distracting shot from your longbow or shortbow; when you do, select one ally who is adjacent to the creature you are targeting with the distracting shot. If you hit the creature, the chosen ally gains a +2 bonus to her Armor Class against that creature. This bonus to her Armor Class lasts until the start of your next turn. Advanced Prerequisites : Dex 17, Divine Fighting Technique, Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, base attack bonus +10. Optional Replacement : A lawful good ranger who worships Erastil and has the Divine Fighting Technique feat can replace the bonus feat granted by his combat style at 10th level with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites. Advanced Benefit : When you fire a distracting shot at a creature and hit the creature, you grant a +4 Armor Class bonus to the selected adjacent ally and a +2 Armor Class bonus to all other allies within 30 feet of the selected adjacent ally against attacks by the targeted creature.  Gorum's Swordmanship Source   Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 11 Gorum teaches devastating greatsword techniques. Optional Replacement : A chaotic neutral barbarian or fighter who worships Gorum can replace a bonus feat or rage power with the following initial benefit. Initial Benefit : If you have the Vital Strike feat, you can apply its effect to an attack you make with a greatsword at the end of a charge. If you don\u2019t have the Vital Strike feat, that attack deals 1 additional point of damage instead. The first time you make an attack of opportunity with a greatsword after using Vital Strike with a greatsword on your turn, you can apply Vital Strike to that attack of opportunity. Advanced Prerequisites : Str 13, Cleave, Power Attack, Vital Strike, base attack bonus +10. Optional Replacement : A chaotic neutral barbarian or fighter of at least 10th level who worships Gorum can replace a bonus feat or rage power with the following advanced benefit, even if she doesn\u2019t meet the prerequisites. Advanced Benefit : When you use Vital Strike, Improved Vital Strike, or Greater Vital Strike with a greatsword, the damage counts as continuous damage from an injury for the purpose of determining whether a target must attempt a concentration check to cast spells ( Core Rulebook  206).  Iomedae's Inspiring Sword Source   Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 11 Iomedae demonstrates how to turn a longsword into a shining beacon of hope. Optional Replacement : A paladin who worships Iomedae can replace a mercy with this initial benefit, even if she doesn\u2019t meets its prerequisites. Initial Benefit : While wielding a longsword, you can perform an impressive display of prowess as a full-round action. All allies within 30 feet who can see your display gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round + 1 round per 5 points of base attack bonus you have. Advanced Prerequisites : Dazzling Display, Weapon Focus (longsword), base attack bonus +10. Optional Replacement : A paladin of at least 9th level who worships Iomedae can replace a mercy with the following advanced benefit, even if she doesn\u2019t meet the benefit\u2019s prerequisites. Advanced Benefit : As a standard action or at the end of a charge, you can make an attack against a foe with a longsword. If you succeed, you grant all allies who can see your attack a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 minute.  Irori\u2019s Perfected Fist Source   Divine Anthology pg. 29 Practically synonymous with Irori and his faith,  The Woven Fist  is among the best known of all diving fighting manuals. Many learned monks were taught their first martial techniques using drills and regiments from this manual, which some claim was written by Irori\u2019s own hand before his ascension to divinity. Although most commonly found in temples to Irori and secluded monasteries, copies of  The Woven Fist  often make their way into less scrupulous hands because of their effectiveness. Optional Replacement : A lawful neutral brawler or monk can replace a bonus feat with the following initial benefit. Initial Benefit : You can take a \u20132 penalty on all attack rolls made with your unarmed strikes in order to deal the average amount of damage with each successful attack instead of rolling your weapon damage. For instance, if your unarmed strike would normally deal 1d4 points of weapon damage, you instead deal 2 points of weapon damage. Apply bonuses and modifiers to this result as if you had rolled your damage normally. You must choose to use this benefit before making an attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. You do not average additional damage dice (such as those granted by a sneak attack) when using this ability. Advanced Prerequisites : Critical Focus; Divine Fighting Technique; Weapon Focus (unarmed strike); base attack bonus +10 or monk level 10th. Optional Replacement : A lawful neutral brawler or monk of at least 10th level who worships Irori and has the Divine Fighting Technique feat can replace a bonus feat with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites. Advanced Benefit : You no longer take a \u20132 penalty on attack rolls with your unarmed strikes when you choose to deal the average amount of damage. If you critically hit a creature when using this ability, you automatically inflict maximum weapon damage for that critical hit (although you must still roll sneak attack dice or any other dicebased additional damage).   Lamashtu's Carving Source   Divine Anthology pg. 29 One of the grisliest divine fighting manuals is  Fecundity of Corpses , a harrowing tome that depicts the fighting styles favored by the followers of Lamashtu, the Mother of Monsters. In addition to detailing many of the more gruesome rites favored by the Demon Queen,  Fecundity of Corpses  includes hundreds of techniques recorded in blood by cultists of Lamashtu from across the Inner Sea region. Though no standardized edition of this manual exists because of the cult\u2019s discordant hierarchy, each tome manages to perfectly capture similar techniques for sowing fear and blood in Lamashtu\u2019s name. Initial Benefit : As a standard action, you can make a single attack with a falchion or a kukri in order to deal bleed damage to the target. When you make this attack, you do not apply your ability modifier (normally Strength, but potentially other modifiers) to the hit point damage dealt by your attack\u2014instead, add an amount of bleed damage equal to this modifier. The bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or any amount of magical healing. Bleed damage from this benefit doesn\u2019t stack with itself. Advanced Prerequisites : Str 13, Dazing Assault APG , Divine Fighting Technique, Power Attack. Advanced Benefit : Whenever you hit a bleeding creature with a melee attack using a falchion or a kukri, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) or become staggered for 1 round. Multiple attacks do not cause this condition to stack, and a creature that successfully saves against this staggering effect is immune to this effect for 1 round.  Norgorber\u2019s Silent Shiv Source   Divine Anthology pg. 30 Entombed within a volume known as  The Reaper\u2019s Hand , the divine fighting techniques of Norgorber are among the most elusive in the Inner Sea region, but are theorized to cover the techniques that acolytes of Father Skinsaw use to move and strike unseen. Copies of this manual are rare, and those who spill its secrets to anyone unworthy often meet a swift and bloody end at the hands of the faith\u2019s inquisitors. Optional Replacement : A neutral evil rogue of at least 2nd level who worships Norgorber can replace a rogue talent with the following initial benefit. Initial Benefit : Whenever you attack an opponent that is completely unaware of your presence (such as when you are using the Stealth skill or invisible), your attack deals damage as if you were one size category larger. This benefit applies only to the first attack that you make against the target, and only with attacks made with light or one-handed weapons intended for creatures of your size (including thrown attacks). Advanced Prerequisites : Divine Fighting Technique, Stealth 10 ranks.  Optional Replacement : A neutral evil rogue of at least 10th level who worships Norgorber can replace an advanced rogue talent with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites. Advanced Benefit : At the start of each round, choose one opponent that you can see and attempt a Stealth check as a swift action. If the result of your check exceeds the target\u2019s CMD, treat the target as if it were completely unaware of your presence for the purpose of the initial benefit of this divine fighting technique. If you beat the target\u2019s CMD by 5 or more, you also treat it as being completely unaware of your presence for the purposes of all class features and feats you have.  Rovagug\u2019s Thunder Source   Divine Anthology pg. 30 Most copies of  Ravage and Ruin , the divine fighting manual of the Rough Beast Rovagug, are scrawled in blood upon flensed skins by orc priests\u2014and indeed the vile techniques described within originated from the Hold of Belkzen not long after the orcs first seized that land as their own. Reviled across the Inner Sea,  Ravage and Ruin  sees additional use among savage Ulfen clans who have fallen to the Rough Beast\u2019s urges to become corrupt, lunatic cannibals who relish despoiling beauty in Rovagug\u2019s name. Initial Benefit : Whenever you succeed at a dirty trick APG  combat maneuver check against an opponent, you deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier. In addition, whenever your dirty trick combat maneuver check beats an opponent\u2019s CMD by 5 or more, you can forgo increasing the duration of your condition by 1 or more rounds to instead impose a \u20132 penalty on all of that opponent\u2019s Charisma-based checks. This penalty doesn\u2019t stack with itself, and it lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 minute) or until the target receives any form of magical healing. Advanced Prerequisites : Power Attack, Divine Fighting Technique, base attack bonus +10. Optional Replacement : A chaotic evil barbarian of at least 10th level who worships Rovagug can replace a rage power with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites. Advanced Benefit : Anytime you use Power Attack with a great axe or a natural attack, you ignore an amount of the target\u2019s hardness or damage reduction equal to the penalty Power Attack imparts to your attack roll. This benefit stacks with Penetrating Strike and Greater Penetrating Strike.  Sarenrae's Mercy Source   Divine Anthology pg. 30 Although the Dawnflower is the goddess of healing and redemption, she is not a goddess of peace, and her followers are taught that combat may be the only way to ensure the safety of those who look to the faith for protection. In such situations, the faithful of Sarenrae are expected to end combat swiftly and efficiently, to avoid drawing out the pain and agony of battle. When one can end a battle without resorting to killing, the opportunity for redemption of the defeated foe still remains. The pages of  Dawnflower\u2019s Mercies  teach methods by which those who serve Sarenrae as soldiers can vanquish enemies in combat without killing them, and encourage those who follow the teachings held within to offer those they take prisoner the chance to be welcomed into Sarenrae\u2019s arms. Initial Benefit : You take no penalty on attack rolls for using a scimitar to deal nonlethal damage. If your attack with the scimitar would normally deal additional damage (such as via sneak attack, the flaming weapon special ability, or the like), this additional damage can be nonlethal damage. You can also alter spells with the fire, good, or light descriptor and inflict spells so that the damage they deal is nonlethal damage instead. You can choose to apply this effect as the spell is cast. Advanced Prerequisites : Great Fortitude, Weapon Focus (scimitar), Heal 10 ranks. Advanced Benefit : Once per round as you strike a foe with a weapon and deal nonlethal damage with that attack, you regain 1d6 hit points as the warmth of Sarenrae\u2019s approval and the conviction that you are doing the right thing to minimize suffering infuses your body and soul. If the attack that dealt nonlethal damage was from a scimitar, you instead regain 2d6 hit points. You can gain the benefit of this healing only once per round, regardless of how many successful attacks you make with the weapon.  Torag's Patient Strikes Source   Divine Anthology pg. 31 Copies of  Lessons of the Father , the divine fighting manual of Torag, are somewhat rare outside of the Five Kings Mountains, as tradition mandates that all copies of  Lessons of the Father  must be scribed by hand in Dwarven on iron sheets and bound between slabs of stone hand-carved by a cleric of Torag. As a result, these tomes are somewhat cumbersome to transport (even the smallest copy of the book weighs 50 pounds, and most exceed 100 pounds in weight). Those who have mastered the  Lessons of the Father  are highly respected within the faith. Initial Benefit : Whenever you wield a warhammer, add your Wisdom bonus to the total number of attacks of opportunity that you can make per round. These additional attacks of opportunity don\u2019t stack with those granted by Combat Reflexes, but this benefit counts as Combat Reflexes for the purpose of satisfying feat prerequisites and prestige class requirements. In addition, you can make attacks of opportunity while you\u2019re flat-footed. Advanced Prerequisites : Divine Fighting Technique, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (warhammer), base attack bonus +10. Advanced Benefit : Once per round, before you make an attack of opportunity with a warhammer, you can declare an opportunistic strike. If the attack hits, you can apply the effects of your Vital Strike feat. You can apply the Improved Vital Strike or Greater Vital Strike feat instead if you have either of those feats. If you confirm a critical hit with an opportunistic strike, you can attempt a disarm or trip combat maneuver check against the target as a free action\u2014this combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.  Urgathoa's Hunger Source   Divine Anthology pg. 31 The grisly content of  Pallid Cravings  can be found in many places where the Pallid Princess maintains a significant presence, especially within the undead nation of Geb. The pages of this manuscript are said to be tattooed onto a humanoid and flensed off while the victim is still alive; the swaths of skin are then carefully preserved for presentation in the book.  Pallid Cravings  details hundreds of ways for a member of Urgathoa\u2019s faithful to satisfy her depraved urges for an opponent\u2019s flesh and blood while in battle. Initial Benefit : A number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus, you can feast upon the life essence of a creature that you hit with a scythe. Activating this ability is a swift action. When you do so, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you dealt with the scythe attack. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute and don\u2019t stack. Advanced Prerequisites : Divine Fighting Technique, Heal 10 ranks, base attack bonus +7.  Advanced Benefit : A number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus, you can exacerbate any lingering contagions within a target\u2019s body upon making a successful melee attack with a scythe. Activating this ability is a swift action, and causes the target to immediately attempt additional saving throws against all diseases with which it is currently afflicted. Any failed saves cause the target to immediately take the effects of that disease, while a successful save does not count toward the number of consecutive saves that the target must succeed at in order to cure the disease.  Zon-Kuthon's Flensing Source   Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 11 Zon-Kuthon invites all mortals to join in inflicting and suffering pain. Initial Benefit : Once per round, when you hit a foe with a spiked chain, you can twist the chain so it painfully flenses both of you. You and your target are both sickened for 1 round, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom bonus) or be sickened for an additional 1d4+1 rounds. Advanced Prerequisites : Base attack bonus +10. Advanced Benefit : Whenever you sicken a foe with pain using a spiked chain (whether by flensing, as a dirty trick APG  combat maneuver, or otherwise), the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom bonus) or be nauseated for the first round of the duration.

    "special": "You can take this feat only once. If you ever gain a bloodrager or sorcerer bloodline, you must take draconic as your chosen bloodline (or a bloodline tied to some other creature of the dragon type, as approved by your GM). True Dragons Though it is still uncommon, true dragons are most likely to interact directly with humanoid races, though a few take on humanoid forms and move among mortals until the time is right to reveal themselves. Such dragons rarely adopt these guises for long, as those who lose themselves in humanoid form are seen as pariahs by their own kind.    Chromatic While not all who carry the blood of chromatic dragons are evil, the potency of their blood and the malevolence inherent in it can have strong subconscious effects, tempting them to embrace their sinister urges. Humanoids with blood empowered by chromatic dragons tend toward muscular builds and can imbue their fists with the dragons\u2019 energy.  Draconic Heritage : Choose acid, cold, electricity or fire when you take this feat; the choice cannot be changed once made. As a swift action, you can shroud your arms in your chosen element for 1 round. Unarmed strikes with your arms or hands (or attacks with weapons held in those hands) deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage of the appropriate type. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma bonus.    Esoteric Those with the power of esoteric dragons take aloofness to an extreme and are prone to long nights of sleep and vivid, enrapturing dreams. They are often deeply empathetic and emotional individuals, feeling the needs and wants of others intimately and, in some cases, more intensely than they can handle.  Draconic Heritage : As a standard action, you can project a psychic barrage at a creature within 15 feet to which you have line of sight. A creature targeted by your psychic barrage must succeed at a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. You can attempt a psychic barrage once per day for every 4 characters levels you have (minimum 1). This is a mindaffecting effect.  Special : If you have 1 or more levels in a class that casts psychic spells, you can attempt a psychic barrage a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your level in that class (minimum 1), plus one more time per day for every 4 levels you have in other classes.    Imperial Imperial dragons see themselves as masters of their respective domains, and those with heritages influenced by their legacies often have this same aggressively territorial nature. Individuals with this heritage tend to be charismatic, commanding, and proud people who have an unusual intensity.  Draconic Heritage : As a swift action, you emit an aura of command with a 10-foot radius for 1 round. Allies within your aura gain a +2 bonus on Will saves against fear. Enemies in your aura take a \u20132 penalty on Will saves against fear. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma bonus.    Metallic Metallic dragons leave an impression of kindness and hope in those infused with a portion of their power. Those who bear the blood of metallic dragons sometimes have iridescent hair of pale metallic hues and irises colored like polished metal.  Draconic Heritage : Choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire when you take this feat; the choice cannot be changed once made. As a swift action, you gain energy resistance 5 against your chosen element. This energy resistance lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma bonus.    Outer The utterly alien nature of outer dragons often conflicts with the more grounded and material upbringing of those who carry these dragons\u2019 influence within their bloodlines. Feelings of otherness or exclusion are common among humanoids with this bloodline, and many become exiles or wanderers.  Draconic Heritage : As a swift action, you can generate an alien aura around yourself with a 5-foot radius that lasts for 1 round. Any enemy who enters your aura must succeed at a Will save or become sickened for 1 round. A creature who successfully saves against your alien aura is immune to its effects for 24 hours. You can generate an alien aura once per day for every 4 characters levels you have (minimum 1). This is a mind-affecting effect.    Primal The scions with the power of the elementally attuned primal dragons are not often subtle in appearance. They tend towards hardy builds and skin tones that take on shimmering, iridescent hues in direct light. Additionally, they often experience tempestuous emotions that are difficult to control.  Draconic Heritage : Choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire when you take this feat; once made, this choice cannot be changed. As a standard action, you can create a 10-footradius aura of elemental energy that lasts for 1 round. The area of this aura is considered difficult terrain, and creatures that end their turns in your aura take 1d6 points of energy damage of the appropriate type. A successful Fortitude save halves this damage but does not negate the difficult terrain effect. You can create an aura of elemental energy once per day for every 4 characters levels you have (minimum 1).  Special : If you are a druid, hunter, or kineticist, you can create an elemental aura a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your class level (minimum 1), plus one more time per day for every 4 levels you have in other classes.    Lesser Dragons Bloodlines infused with the power of lesser dragons are exceedingly rare, as such creatures lack both the means by which to take human form (and create a blood descendant), and the magical puissance to otherwise instill their legacy into a bloodline. On the world of Triaxus, dragonkin riders form supernatural bonds with their mounts that, in rare cases, affects the riders\u2019 children, allowing them to share in that draconic bond in a more physical manner. Other lesser draconic heritages are the result of binding dragon spirits to physical bloodlines and similar supernatural origins.    Drake Creatures with drake ancestry are often swift-footed and have quick reflexes, mirroring the speed and grace of drakes. They tend to be wiry and athletic with long limbs and wild, untamed demeanors that thrive best beyond the boundaries of civilization. Befitting the variety of different drake breeds in the world, those with drake bloodlines often have hair or eye colors reminiscent of the scales of the drake breed to which they\u2019re related. Some might exhibit additional minor features suggestive of a specific draconic heritage, but such features provide no statistical benefit.  Draconic Heritage : As a swift action, you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to your base speed for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma bonus.    Linnorm The cursed blood of linnorms is a unique case\u2014it is sometimes passed down by those who bear a child while under the effects of a linnorm\u2019s death curse. Such an unlikely offspring usually bears a visible mark or scar that ties her life to the legacy of that linnorm.  Draconic Heritage : As an immediate action when you are damaged by a melee attack, you can afflict your attacker with a curse. The target of your curse must succeed at a Will save or take a \u20132 penalty on all ability checks, attack rolls, and skill checks for 1 round. You can use this curse once per day for every 4 characters levels you have (minimum 1).  Special : If you are a shaman or a witch, you can use this curse a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your class level (minimum 1), plus one more time per day for every 4 levels you have in other classes.

Both spells must have an elemental descriptor (air, earth, fire, or water), or an energy descriptor that corresponds to one of the elements (acid [earth], cold [water], electricity [air], or fire [fire]) . Both spells must be at least 1st level, within 1 spell level of each other, and cast during the same initiative turn through the use of readied actions.  When the spells to be commixed are cast, one is designated as the primary spell (typically the higherlevel spell), while the other is the secondary spell. The primary spell must be an offensive spell that targets an area or one or more creatures. The secondary spell can be any spell with an appropriate descriptor. Neither spell can take more than a standard action to cast. The primary spell behaves as written (with the exception of the synergistic benefits that are described below). The secondary spell does not manifest any of its usual effects; instead, targeted creatures are affected by a secondary effect that is determined by the combination of the two spells\u2019 descriptors.  Targeted creatures can attempt a saving throw against the primary spell as normal (assuming that a save is normally allowed), and then attempt a separate save against the secondary effect. The secondary effect\u2019s save type is described in its listing, and its save DC is equal to the normal save DC of the primary or secondary spell, whichever is lower (or, if neither spell allows a saving throw, 10 + lowest spell\u2019s level + spellcaster\u2019s primary spellcasting ability score [Int, Wis, or Cha] modifier).  Commixed spells cannot be counterspelled normally. A creature with Improved Counterspell can counterspell commixed spells if both spells are correctly identified and both belong to the same school. Regardless, the secondary effects of two spells combined through Elemental Commixture cannot be counterspelled. Spell resistance still applies to the secondary effect, unless both of the commixed spells bypass spell resistance.   Synergistic Benefits : The primary spell\u2019s save DC (if any) increases by 1. If either spell is normally modified by Spell Focus or Greater Spell Focus, the bonus to save DCs granted by those feats stacks with this increase. The caster of the primary spell also gains a +1 bonus on any caster level check made to overcome spell resistance.   Secondary Effects : While the secondary spell has no direct effect other than bolstering the effects of the primary spell, the combination of spells also creates a unique secondary effect depending on the elemental descriptors of the commixed spells. For the purpose of this secondary effect, the acid, cold, and electricity descriptors count as earth, water, and air descriptors, respectively. Commixed spells with the same elemental descriptors do not produce a secondary effect, though the primary spell still gains the synergistic benefits described above.  Dust (Air/Earth) : Choked by dust, the targets must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round plus 1 round per 5 caster levels of the secondary spell\u2019s caster. Targeted spellcasters must succeed at a concentration check to cast spells (the DC is equal to the save DC). On a successful save, the targets are not staggered but must still attempt concentration checks. Lava (Earth/Fire) : The targets are splattered with bits of molten rock and take 1d6 points of fire damage. The targets must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire (see Catching on Fire on page 444 of the  Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook ). Mud (Earth/Water) : The targets must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone and have their movement speeds cut in half (to a minimum speed of 5 feet) for 1 round plus 1 round per 5 caster levels of the secondary spell\u2019s caster. On a successful save, the targets\u2019 movement speeds are cut in half for 1 round. Smoke (Air/Fire) : The targets suffer smoke inhalation and must succeed at Fortitude saves or become nauseated for 1 round and blinded for 1d4 rounds. Success negates the nausea effect and reduces the blindness to 1 round. Creatures immune to fire are immune to the nausea effect. Snow (Air/Water) : The primary spell gains the cold descriptor if it doesn\u2019t have that descriptor already, and half the damage dealt (if any) is cold damage. The targets must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone. Steam (Fire/Water) : Damage caused by the primary spell (if any) is treated as nonlethal, untyped damage (neither cold nor fire damage) and is not affected by energy resistance or absorbed by  protection from energy . The targets become blinded for 1d4 rounds unless they succeed at a Will save.",

Anvil Tricks Source   Magical Marketplace pg. 14 In addition to the feat or skill requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (anvil) feat. You may use these tricks with any anvil weighing 50 pounds or more. Counterweight (Climb 5 ranks) : You can use your anvil as a counterweight when you climb a rope or chain to reduce your Climb DC by 5. Improve Armor (Craft [armor] 5 ranks) : You can spend an hour with your anvil and a suit of nonmagical metal armor to temporarily increase the armor\u2019s armor bonus by 1. This bonus ends after the next time the wearer is hit. Quick Fix (Craft [any] 5 ranks) : You can spend 1 minute with your anvil and a metal item with the broken condition to remove the broken condition from the item for 1 hour. The item does not recover any hit points, and at the end of the hour it regains the broken condition and loses an additional 1d6 hit points (unless properly fixed by then). Smash Through (Improved Bull Rush) : When you end your move adjacent to a closed door, you can open the door as part of your move action (instead of as a separate move action) by smashing it with an anvil as you move. If the door is stuck or locked, you must succeed at a bull rush combat maneuver check that exceeds the door\u2019s break DC.  Boot Tricks Source   Dirty Tactics Toolbox pg. 18 In addition to the feat or skill prerequisites (listed in parentheses) for each of the following tricks, you must have the appropriate Equipment Trick feat. A pair of boots refers to any set of footwear that has hard soles. These equipment tricks can be used with either magic or mundane boots. Cleat Stomp (Improved Unarmed Strike) : When you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent while wearing a pair of boots with cleats ( Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment  88), the target takes 1 point of bleed damage. The bleed damage can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal skill check or by magical healing. The effects of this trick stack with other sources of bleed damage but not with other bleed damage dealt by this trick. Heel Crush (Improved Dirty Trick ACG ) : When you succeed at a successful dirty trick combat maneuver check against an opponent within melee range, you can crush the target\u2019s foot or similar appendage with your boot heel. Instead of inflicting one of the conditions that can normally be imposed by a dirty trick, you reduce the target\u2019s movement speed by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). You can\u2019t use a dirty trick combat maneuver in this manner against an opponent that is using a movement type other than its land speed, and movement types other than land speeds aren\u2019t affected by this equipment trick. As usual, a creature with a movement speed of 5 feet can\u2019t take a 5-foot step. Sharp Veer (Combat Reflexes) : Whenever you use the charge or run action, you can make one 90-degree turn during your movement. You must move at least 10 feet in a straight line after this turn if you are charging.  Cloak Tricks Source   Dirty Tactics Toolbox pg. 18 In addition to the feat or skill prerequisites (listed in parentheses) for each of the following tricks, you must have the appropriate Equipment Trick feat. At the GM\u2019s discretion, you can use these tricks with any cloth object that is roughly the same size and shape as a cloak for a creature of your size (such as a curtain). Dazzling Trail (Dazzling Display) : When you successfully use Intimidate to demoralize an opponent while wearing a cloak, you can increase the duration of the demoralize effect by 1d4 rounds. Distracting Cloak (Stealth 3 ranks) : When you attempt a Bluff check to feint, you can use your cape to create a diversion instead of denying your opponent his Dexterity bonus to AC. Compare the result of your Bluff check against the feint DC of each opponent that can see you (DC = 10 + the opponent\u2019s base attack bonus + the opponent\u2019s Wisdom modifier, or 10 + the opponent\u2019s Sense Motive bonus if he is trained in Sense Motive and this bonus is higher). You can attempt a Stealth check to hide from any opponent that you successfully feint against in this manner, even if that opponent is observing you. If you do not have cover or concealment against any of these targets at the start of each of their turns, they automatically spot you at that time. Parachute Cloak (Acrobatics 5 ranks) : While wearing a cloak, you can adjust your grip so that it catches the air as you fall. If you use both of your hands to hold on to your cloak as you fall, you can attempt a DC 20 Acrobatics check to ignore the first 20 feet fallen (as opposed to the usual DC 15 check to ignore only the first 10 feet), and you avoid falling prone at the end of your jump even if you take damage. Suerte de Capote (Dueling Cape ACG ) : While using the Dueling Cape feat to wield a cloak or similar object as a buckler, you gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks to feint in combat. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 ranks in Sleight of Hand that you possess. Additionally, you can release your cape as a free action whenever you successfully feint an opponent with a melee attack to entangle it, as detailed in the Dueling Cape feat.  Heavy Blade Scabbard Tricks Source   Adventurer's Armory pg. 22 In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (heavy blade scabbard) feat to use a trick. You may use these tricks with any sword scabbard designed for a heavy blade (see the fighter weapon groups on page 56 of the  Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook ). At your GM\u2019s discretion, you may be able to use some of these tricks with a scabbard intended for a light blade, but that requires a separate Equipment Trick feat and may be less effective. Capture Weapon (Improved Disarm) : When you successfully disarm an opponent\u2019s manufactured weapon, as a free action you may flip the disarmed weapon into your scabbard so long as the weapon would fit there. If you are not holding the scabbard in hand and attempt this, you have a \u20134 penalty on the disarm check. At the GM\u2019s discretion, you can also use this trick on any item the opponent is holding as long as it would fit in your scabbard (such as a wand). You can only use this trick if you are wearing or holding your empty scabbard. Find the Hidden (Blind-Fight) : You can use your scabbard to probe for hidden dangers. As a move action, you may sweep your scabbard through an adjacent square where you suspect there is an invisible creature; make a touch attack and roll the miss chance normally. If it hits and you have an available attack, you may attack that target once with a \u20132 penalty and no miss chance for invisibility. All other attacks you make against that creature (whether in that round or otherwise) do not gain this benefit (though you can sweep again on your next turn). Grab Purchase (Climb 5 ranks) : You can use your scabbard as leverage to halt a fall, keep yourself from getting dragged, or prevent other sorts of involuntary movement by grabbing your scabbard with a free hand, jamming it into a hard surface, and clinging to it. Whenever you fail a Climb check, you may attempt to catch yourself while falling with a +10 bonus; your GM may rule that some walls require you to hold your scabbard with two hands rather than one or are too smooth for this trick to work. If subjected to involuntary movement such as a bull rush, you may spend a move action from your next turn to use your scabbard as an anchor, giving you a +5 bonus to your CMD to resist the movement. If you spend this move action, you only get a standard action during your next turn. Hurl Scabbard (Quick Draw) : You can draw your weapon in such a way that you send your combat scabbard (see page 3) whirling off to strike at any creature in sight. This ranged attack is a swift action and is treated as a thrown weapon. Steer Opponent (Improved Bull Rush) : You can use your scabbard to move a foe into the perfect position for you to make your attack. As a swift action, use your scabbard to make a bull rush against an opponent. If you succeed, instead of pushing him back, you direct your target into the path of your next attack. You gain a +2 bonus on your next attack roll against the target, and +1 for every additional 5 feet your bull rush could have pushed your opponent if you had chosen to push him back. If you fail the bull rush attempt, you are considered flat-footed against that target until your next turn. Tangle Leg (Improved Trip, Throw Anything) : When you draw your weapon, you may send its combat scabbard whirling off to strike an opponent\u2019s legs. This bonus attack is a swift action and requires you to make a trip attack against the target. The target can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone. Failing this attempt does not knock you prone unless you are within your opponent\u2019s reach.  Instrument Tricks Source   Adventurer's Armory 2 pg. 19 Bards and other musicians must sometimes improvise more than their music. These instrument tricks expand any musical instrument\u2019s uses and supplement the Equipment Trick feat presented on page 2. Some tricks might be unusable for certain instruments at the GM\u2019s discretion; for example, an organ is too unwieldy to use as an improvised weapon. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (instrument) feat to use a trick. Attention Grabber (Perform 5 ranks, Bluff 5 ranks or bardic performance or raging song class feature) : Your loud or discordant performance covers your allies\u2019 movements. Creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear you play an instrument take a \u20132 penalty on Perception checks, other than Perception checks made in response to your actions, for as long as you play. Goad Animal (Handle Animal 5 ranks or Animal Affinity) : You can use your soothing performance to handle an animal that is friendly toward you, such as a mount or pet. When playing your instrument, commanding the animal to perform a trick it knows is a free action, and pushing it to perform a trick it does not know is a standard action. If you already can make an animal respond more quickly, such as with the link ability of an animal companion, this trick provides no benefit. Jaw-Dropping Distraction (Perform 7 ranks, Bluff 7 ranks or bardic performance or raging song class feature) : When using your instrument, you can attempt a Perform check instead of a Bluff check to feint an opponent. If you succeed, the creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against one target of your choosing (other than you) until the beginning of your next turn. Once you have used this trick against a creature, whether or not you succeeded at the check, you cannot use this trick to feint the creature for 24 hours. Creatures with uncanny dodge are immune to this trick. Play to the Crowd (Perform 3 ranks, Diplomacy 3 ranks or bardic performance or raging song class feature) : You can use Perform, rather than Diplomacy, to improve an NPC\u2019s initial attitude toward you as long as you are able to perform for at least 1 minute. You cannot use this trick to increase the NPC\u2019s attitude beyond friendly. Ruffian\u2019s Riff (Catch Off-Guard) : You can treat a musical instrument as an improvised weapon with the performance UE  special feature. When you use a masterwork musical instrument as an improvised weapon, you treat it as a masterwork weapon (adding a +1 enhancement bonus on your attack rolls). Your attacks with a magical musical instrument are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  Kaava Musk Tricks Source   Sargava, the Lost Colony pg. 25 In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you normally must have the Equipment Trick (Kaava musk) feat to use a trick. You can, however, attempt Kaava musk tricks marked with an asterisk without the Equipment Trick (Kaava musk) feat, but you have a 50% chance of splashing yourself with the musk instead of completing the trick; this failure uses the dose of the musk (and in most cases invalidates what you were planning to use the musk for). Careful Steps (Nimble Moves or Acrobatics 5 ranks) : You can pass through a square splashed with Kaava musk without getting any of it on you. Fast Flask (Quick Draw) : You can draw an easily accessible flask of Kaava musk as a free action rather than a standard action. Make the Kill (scent ability or scent rage power) : You gain a +1 morale bonus on weapon attack and weapon damage rolls when attacking a target marked with Kaava musk. Musk Blinding (Blinding Critical) : When using Kaava musk as a thrown weapon, increase the Fortitude save DC of the blinding critical effect by +5. Musk Poison (poison use class ability)* : You can apply Kaava musk to a melee or thrown weapon as if it were a poison. This makes your weapon reek in the normal manner. However, the first creature struck by your weapon also gains the musk-stink as if it were splashed by a full container of musk 2 days ago. The struck target can wash off the musk on the next round in the normal manner, but otherwise it continues to stink for 2 more days. Kaava musk applied to small items like ammunition has no effect. Musk Sickening (Sickening Critical) : When using Kaava musk as a thrown weapon, increase the duration of the sickening critical effect by 1 minute. Reactive Splashing (Improved Disarm)* : When disarming an opponent of a flask of Kaava musk, you can have the flask break at your opponent\u2019s feet, automatically splashing him with the musk. Splashproof Shield (Shield Focus) : If you are using a shield and are hit with Kaava musk, you can make a Reflex save to use the shield to prevent any of the musk from touching you (thus, if you drop the shield, you do not have any of the musk penalties). The DC for this ability is 10 if using a tower shield, 15 for a heavy shield, 20 for a light shield, and 25 for a buckler. You cannot use this trick if you are flat-footed or helpless. Stink-Fighting (Blind-Fight) : Your familiarity with Kaava musk allows you to pinpoint an invisible muskmarked creature with a Perception check at only a \u201310 penalty rather than the normal \u201320 penalty.  Ladder Tricks Source   Adventurer's Armory 2 pg. 14 Ladders are not a common adventuring staple due to their cumbersome size. Yet some adventurers who take ladders with them into the field use them to great effect. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (ladder) feat to use a trick. Guarding Ladder (Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes) : You can hold a ladder in one hand and treat it as a heavy wooden shield with the fragile UE  special feature. While holding a ladder, you can use the aid another action (or related abilities, such as the Bodyguard APG  feat) to improve the AC of an ally up to 10 feet away. Ladder Fighter (Catch Off-Guard) : You treat a ladder as a quarterstaff with the fragile UE  and trip special features, and you can apply feats and abilities as if it were a quarterstaff (for example, a monk can use a ladder to perform a flurry of blows). Ladder Lock (Improved Dirty Trick APG ) : When you successfully perform a dirty trick combat maneuver against an adjacent opponent while you are holding a ladder, you can trap your target\u2019s limbs between the rungs of the ladder. Your target gains the entangled condition in addition to the normal condition imposed by your dirty trick, and for the same duration. If the target removes the other condition, it also removes the entangled condition, and vice versa. Vaulting Ladder (Acrobatics 3 ranks, Climb 3 ranks, or Acrobatic) : You can climb the length of a ladder as part of a running jump, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus on your Acrobatics check and adding the ladder\u2019s length to the total distance you travel with your jump. You must let go of the ladder when you jump.  Lantern Tricks Source   Adventurer's Armory 2 pg. 14 Lanterns come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Each of these tricks can be performed with any sort of lantern or lamp, except when a specific kind of lamp is indicated in the description. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (lantern) feat to use a trick. Intensified Oil (Craft [alchemy] 3 ranks) : You can combine three flasks of oil into a single use of improved oil as you add it to a lamp or lantern. This improved oil causes the lamp or lantern to which it is added to burn more brightly than usual, increasing its light range by 50%. This improved oil can only be used in the lamp or lantern it\u2019s mixed in and has no additional special effects. Lantern Bash (Shield Focus) : If you carry a lamp or lantern in the hand you use to wield a light shield, your shield bash attacks with that shield deal an additional 1 point of fire damage. Lantern Bomb (Quick Draw) : You can throw a lamp or lantern with at least 4 hours of oil remaining in it as a splash weapon, using the rules for alchemist\u2019s fire. Lesser Light (no additional prerequisites) : When lighting a lamp or lantern, you reduce the size of its flame to provide only dim light in the area in which the lantern usually provides normal light. The lamp or lantern uses oil at half the usual rate. The lamp or lantern must be extinguished and re-lit to shed light normally. Oil Splash (Improved Dirty Trick) : You can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against an opponent while either you or the opponent is holding a lamp or lantern. If you succeed at this combat maneuver check, you can knock some oil from the lamp or lantern into your target\u2019s face. Your target is blinded as normal by the dirty trick and takes 1 point of fire damage each round the blindness lasts.  Mirror Tricks Source   Adventurer's Armory 2 pg. 15 Adventurers carry mirrors for many unconventional uses. You may perform the following tricks with a mirror or, at the GM\u2019s discretion, with a similarly reflective handheld item, such as a highly polished piece of metal. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (mirror) feat to use a trick. Blinding Light (Sleight of Hand 3 ranks) : When in an area of normal or bright light, you can use a mirror held in your hand to shine light into the eyes of a creature within 10 feet as a move action. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your ranks in Sleight of Hand) or be dazzled for 1 round. Bold Presentation (Knowledge [religion] 5 ranks) : You can use a move action (rather than a standard action) to use a mirror to hold at bay a creature susceptible to mirrors (such as a vampire). Reflect Gaze (Combat Reflexes) : As an immediate or swift action, you can use a mirror to reflect a gaze attack. You must either be looking at the creature with the gaze attack or averting your eyes to use this ability, and you must succeed at your saving throw to resist the creature\u2019s gaze attack (if you don\u2019t avoid the need to attempt a saving throw by averting your eyes). If you reflect the creature\u2019s gaze back at it, the creature must succeed at a saving throw to resist its own gaze or lose access to its gaze attack for 1 round. If the creature attempts to gaze at you with its attack action, you may attempt to reflect its gaze back at it, as above, or redirect its gaze to a new target within 30 feet of you. In this case, the new creature is treated as the target of the original gaze (unless it is blindfolded or otherwise unable to see), although it is automatically treated as if it is averting its eyes. Telltale Reflection (Spellcraft 3 ranks or racial bonus on saving throws against illusion spells and effects) : You are familiar with the ways illusions don\u2019t precisely mimic natural objects when reflected. If you see an illusion within 10 feet reflected in a mirror, you count as having studied it carefully for the purposes of attempting a saving throw to disbelieve it. Trickster\u2019s Mirror (Spell Focus [illusion]) : You can use a mirror worth at least 10 gp as an additional material component for an illusion (figment) spell. The spell is treated as 1 spell level higher (to a maximum of 9th level) for all purposes, including the calculation of saving throw DCs. Net Tricks Source   Dirty Tactics Toolbox pg. 18 In addition to the feat or skill prerequisites (listed in parentheses) for each of the following tricks, you must have the appropriate Equipment Trick feat. To use any of these equipment tricks, you must be proficient with nets. Binding Trick (Improved Dirty Trick ACG ) : When you succeed at a dirty trick combat maneuver check against a target entangled by a net whose trailing rope you control, the target cannot take an action to remove the condition imposed by the dirty trick until it escapes from or bursts free of the net. Grappling Net (Improved Grapple) : When you attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against a foe entangled by a net whose trailing rope you control, you do not take a penalty on the grapple combat maneuver check for not having two hands free, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. If you successfully pin the target while it is still entangled by the net, you can use the net to tie up the target as a swift action.  Pole Tricks Source   Adventurer's Armory 2 pg. 15 Each of these tricks can be done with a pole or balancing pole, but specific poles have further abilities. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (pole) feat to use a trick. Pole Trip (Catch Off-Guard or Improved Trip) : You can treat a pole as an improvised weapon with the reach and trip special features. You can treat an unhinged folding pole UE  as an improvised weapon with the disarm and trip special features. A pole or folding pole used as an improvised weapon deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage. Seek the Unseen (Perception 1 rank) : When you attempt to find a creature you cannot see (either because it is invisible, or because you are blind), you can sweep a pole through any two adjacent squares within 10 feet of you as a standard action. Make a melee attack against an AC of 10. If you hit, and if a creature you cannot see is in the designated area, you deal no damage but have successfully pinpointed the creature\u2019s current location. Wall Climb (Climb 3 ranks) : You can climb narrow passageways if your pole can reach a wall or other solid surface on both sides, bracing yourself and scooting the pole further along the surface as you climb. This method is reliable but laborious; you gain a +10 circumstance bonus on your Climb checks to climb in this manner, but you climb at half the usual speed.  Rope Tricks Source   Pathfinder Society Field Guide pg. 49 In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (rope) feat to use rope tricks. Rope tricks can be performed with hemp rope or silk rope, or with similar ropelike items at the GM\u2019s discretion.  Coil (Sleight of Hand 5 ranks) : You can coil rope rapidly, requiring only 1 round to coil 20 feet of rope. (Coiling 20 feet of rope normally takes 1d6 rounds.)  Hogtie (Improved Grapple) : When you attempt to tie up an opponent you are grappling, your penalty is only \u20135 instead of the normal \u201310.  Knotted Weapon (Weapon Proficiency [spiked chain]) : You can use a knotted length of rope as a spiked chain that inf licts bludgeoning damage instead of piercing damage.  Lash (Weapon Proficiency [whip]) : You can use a length of rope as a whip at no penalty. The piece of rope that is used as a whip must be 10 feet long\u2014length in excess of this must remain coiled or otherwise unused at your feet or side.  Lifeline (Climb 5 ranks) : When you or a nearby creature is falling (from a failed Climb check or otherwise), you can throw a held rope as an immediate action, maintaining a grip on one end. If you are falling, this is treated as an attempt to catch yourself while falling made with a +10 bonus, but there must be some sort of solid anchor available for your rope to loop around. When attempting this check on another creature, treat it as if you yourself were falling. If the weight of the creature exceeds twice your heavy load limit (your own equipment does not count against this maximum), you are pulled after it.  Quick Release (no additional prerequisites) : You can secure a rope such that you can loose it from either end by making a quick series of tugs (a move action) at any point along the rope\u2019s length.  Slip Away (Escape Artist 5 ranks) : You gain a +10 bonus on Escape Artist checks to escape from ropes and ropelike restraints (such as vines).  Tangle (Throw Anything) : You can throw a coiled length of rope as a ranged weapon. If you hit with a ranged touch attack, the target becomes entangled. It can cut or burst the rope, or escape with a DC 15 Escape Artist check. The rope must be unsecured to use this trick.  Shield Tricks Source   Adventurer's Armory pg. 23 In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (shield) feat and proficiency in (non-tower) shields to use a trick. You may use these tricks with any light or heavy shield. At your GM\u2019s discretion, you may be able to use some of these tricks with a tower shield or buckler, but that requires a separate Equipment Trick feat for that kind of shield and may add a penalty on the associated roll. Break Ground (Improved Trip, Throw Anything) : In place of a melee attack, you can throw your shield at an opponent\u2019s feet, interfering with his movement and perhaps tripping him. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield or using a throwing shield to use this trick. Make a trip attack against your opponent. The opponent can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone. Failing this attempt does not knock you prone unless you are within your opponent\u2019s reach. Whether or not you succeed, as long as your shield remains where you threw it, the opponent treats that square as difficult terrain until he moves out of the square. Hurl Shield (Throw Anything) : You can throw your shield as a ranged improvised weapon. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield to perform this trick. If you are using a throwing shield, there is no reason to use this trick. Little Wall (Escape Artist 5 ranks) : You can contort your body behind your shield in order to gain a brief moment of security. Whenever you use the total defense action, you may choose to gain cover instead of the normal dodge bonus to AC. Keen Eye (Perception 5 ranks) : You have mastered the art of using the reflective surface of your shield to locate foes that you dare not look at directly. On your turn, you may choose to forfeit your shield\u2019s AC bonus for 1 round to improve your defenses against one creature using a gaze attack. Your chance to avoid having to make a saving throw against that creature\u2019s gaze attack increases to 100%, and the creature does not gain concealment against you. For every 5 ranks in Perception you have above 5, you may simultaneously use this ability against another creature with a gaze attack. Release Shield (no prerequisites) : You may remove a light or heavy shield as a swift action instead of a move action. You may remove a throwing shield (see page 5) as a free action. Once you\u2019ve removed the shield, you may hold it in one hand or drop it as a free action. Ricochet Shield (Deadly Aim, Throw Anything) : When you throw a shield, you can bounce it off one or more hard surfaces in order to strike a target from an unexpected angle or to bypass an obstacle such as cover. Each object you ricochet your shield off of imposes a \u20132 penalty on the attack roll. Range increments apply for the total distance the shield travels, not just the direct distance between you and the target. Shield Gag (Improved Grapple, Throw Anything) : You can force your shield into the mouth of a creature to prevent it from using bite attacks or other mouthbased abilities. Make a grapple check against a creature at least two sizes larger than your size category. If you succeed, you wedge your shield into its mouth. At any time you may release your shield, which means you both lose the grappled condition, though your shield remains in its mouth. The creature may remove the shield by destroying it (or leaving it with the broken condition), forcing the shield out of its mouth with a grapple check against your CMB, or swallowing it (if it has the swallow whole ability) as if the shield were a creature. While the shield is in place, the monster cannot use its mouth to make attacks (such as a bite or a giant frog\u2019s sticky tongue) against anything but the shield and cannot speak clearly enough to cast spells or use items requiring speech. If it uses a breath weapon, its range is half normal and any damage dealt must first get through the shield, with any remaining damage affecting the area normally.  Sling Source   Heroes from the Fringe pg. 29 The following sling tricks are commonly used by those trained in the art of the sling. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (sling) feat to use a trick. Charging Snare (Improved Trip) : You can dash toward an opponent and use your sling to trip it up. As a full-round action, you can move up to twice your speed at a foe and attempt a trip combat maneuver. This movement follows the rules of movement during a charge. You gain a +2 bonus on the combat maneuver check, and you take a \u20132 penalty to your AC until the start of your second turn. Disarming Lash (Improved Disarm) : You can lash out with your sling to ensnare an opponent\u2019s weapon and pull it away. When you perform a disarm combat maneuver while wielding a sling, you can use your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier to determine your CMB. Hurl Splash Weapon (Far Shot, Throw Anything) : You can fling a splash weapon with your sling to great effect. As a full-round action, you can use your sling to hurl a splash weapon as a ranged touch attack with a range equal to half your sling\u2019s range. This trick does not work with an alchemist\u2019s bombs. Pouch Bandage (Heal 5 ranks) : You can rapidly wrap your sling around an ally\u2019s wound, stanching the flow of blood. When you or an ally within your reach has the bleed condition, as a standard action, you can bind the wound, stopping the bleed damage from one bleed effect; any other bleed effects still deal their bleed damage.  Smokestick Tricks Source   Adventurer's Armory 2 pg. 25 Often overlooked for alchemist\u2019s fire, smokesticks can provide versatile tactical advantage in the right hands. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (smokestick) feat to use the following trick. Choking Smoke (Improved Dirty Trick APG ) : When you perform a successful dirty trick APG  combat maneuver while holding a lit smokestick, you can shove the smokestick into your opponent\u2019s mouth (or other breathing apparatus) to impair its breathing. The affected creature begins choking and sputtering, gaining the sickened condition. Unlike a normal dirty trick, the foe must succeed at a Fortitude save to remove this condition, in addition to spending an action. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + half your base attack bonus + any bonus you add to dirty trick combat maneuvers (such as that granted by Improved Dirty Trick). This condition ends after 1 minute, if not removed sooner. Creatures that do not breathe are immune to this effect. Slow Burn (Craft [alchemy] 1 rank) : You can burn a smokestick just slowly enough to not consume it immediately. You must choose to use this trick when you light a smokestick. A slow-burning smokestick is not consumed after 1 round, and the smoke produced only lasts for 1 round. For the next hour, as a swift action when you are holding a slow-burning smokestick, you can use the smokestick to produce a cloud of smoke that lasts for only 1 round. The slow-burning smokestick lasts for 1 hour or until you have created a total of 10 clouds, at which point it is consumed. Smoke Shadow (Craft [alchemy] 1 rank; Skill Focus [Stealth] or Stealthy) : You can use a slow-burning smokestick (using the slow burn trick) to conceal your motions while sneaking. While your smokestick is slow-burning, whenever a creature would succeed at an opposed Perception check against your Stealth check, you can emit a puff of smoke as an immediate action to hide your presence. When you do, the creature must reroll its Perception check and take the second result, even if it is worse. Even if the creature fails this Perception check, it is aware of your general location because of the sudden smoke (unless the location is already filled with smoke\u2014like that emitted by the normal use of a smokestick\u2014or fog). Smoke Strike (Craft [alchemy] 1 rank, Improved Feint) : You can use a slow-burning smokestick (using the slow burn trick) to distract foes from your strikes. As a swift action when you are holding a slow-burning smokestick, instead of producing a cloud with the slow burn trick, you can create a small, dense burst of smoke in an adjacent foe\u2019s face. This allows you to feint as part of that swift action.  Sunrod Tricks Source   Pathfinder Society Field Guide pg. 49 In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (sunrod) feat to use a trick.  Flare (Craft [alchemy] 5 ranks or alchemist bomb class feature) : As a standard action, you can expend the remaining life of a sunrod (lit or unlit) in an instant. Sighted creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst of the sunrod must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 2d4 rounds. Creatures with light sensitivity or light blindness receive a \u20132 penalty on their saving throws. Alternatively, as a full-round action, you can strike a creature with the sunrod or throw the sunrod as a ranged attack with a range increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface, it flares as describe above. Since you don\u2019t have to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at the corner of particular 5-foot square. Treat the target corner as AC 5. If a creature is struck by the sunrod and fails its Fortitude save, it is blinded for the first round of its dazzled condition.  Fast Sunrod (Quick Draw) : You can draw and light an easily accessible sunrod from a pack as a swift action.  Like the Sun (ability to cast any spell with the light descriptor) : You can use a sunrod as an additional material component for any spell that bears the light descriptor. The spell is treated as one spell level higher (to a maximum of 9th level) for all purposes, including the calculation of saving throw DCs and its ability to overcome sources of magical darkness.  Lodge Sunrod (Throw Anything) : You can throw your sunrod as a ranged improvised weapon. If you hit with a ranged touch attack, the sunrod does no damage, but stays lodged on the target until the target or another creature spends a move action to remove it. Lure (Handle Animal 5 ranks) : As a move action while holding a lit sunrod in your hand, you can attempt to move an animal in any direction you desire. Make a Handle Animal check against a DC of 15 + the target animal\u2019s CR. If you are successful, the animal moves 5 feet in the desired direction on its next turn. For every 5 points by which your check exceeds the DC, the animal moves another 5 feet, up to the animal\u2019s maximum speed. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, though if one is taken, the animal immediately stops moving (whether or not the attack hits). You cannot move an animal into an obvious hazard with this trick, but you can (for example) lure it into an open cage.  Twice as Brightly (Craft [alchemy] 5 ranks) : As full-round action, you can tamper with an unused sunrod such that it burns out in a single hour, but shines much more brightly. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by two steps for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes normal light, and dim light or normal light becomes bright light). It does not increase the light level in bright light.  Tanglefoot Bag Tricks Source   Adventurer's Armory 2 pg. 26 Tanglefoot bags can be a versatile and even deadly tool in the hands of a skilled user. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (tanglefoot bag) feat to use a trick. At your GM\u2019s discretion, you may be able to use some of these tricks with a tangleburn bag UE , but at the risk of dealing fire damage to connected items or creatures. Captivating Embrace (Improved Grapple) : You get up close and personal, then use a tanglefoot bag to keep things that way. When you successfully grapple a creature, you burst a tanglefoot bag to stick yourself to your target. You must have the tanglefoot bag in hand to use this ability unless you have the Quick Draw feat (in which case the tanglefoot bag must be easily accessible on your person). While the tanglefoot bag\u2019s effect lasts, you do not take a penalty to grapple checks for not having two hands free, and your opponent takes a \u20134 penalty on combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks to break the grapple. Sticky Bombs (Quick Draw, Throw Anything) : You can slap another item on a tanglefoot bag and toss both to ensure contact. When you throw an alchemical item, you can attach a tanglefoot bag to it as you throw it; this does not require an additional action. On a hit, the target is affected by the tanglefoot bag, with the alchemical item firmly stuck in the goo. The item stays in the target\u2019s square as long the tanglefoot bag\u2019s effect lasts, making this most useful with items that don\u2019t immediately take effect, such as darkflares (see above) or fuse grenades UE . Thieving Shield (Shield Focus or armor training class feature) : As an immediate action, you can splatter a tanglefoot bag on your shield, making it sticky. Your shield gains the grapple UE  weapon quality when used as a weapon with a shield bash attack. In addition, the first time each round an attack with a manufactured weapon misses you by 4 or less, you can make a free disarm attempt against that weapon. This disarm attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Your shield remains sticky for 2d4 rounds, after which it must be cleaned (a full-round action) before you can use this trick again.  Thieves' Tools Tricks Source   Dirty Tactics Toolbox pg. 19 In addition to the feat or skill prerequisites (listed in parentheses) for each of the following tricks, you must have the appropriate Equipment Trick feat. Indispensable to a rogue or any other adventurer who wishes to crack open a lock or disable a trap, a set of thieves\u2019 tools contains a number of sharp picks and coarse files. Dirty Pick (Disable Device 1 rank) : You don\u2019t take any penalties for using a set of thieves\u2019 tools as an improvised melee weapon. A set of thieves\u2019 tools used as an improvised weapon deals 1d3 points of piercing damage. Additionally, when you attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check to impose the blinded condition with a set of thieves\u2019 tools, you don\u2019t provoke an attack of opportunity. Masterwork thieves\u2019 tools grant a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and combat maneuver checks for these purposes. Let Myself In (Knowledge [engineering] 3 ranks) : Whenever you succeed at a Disable Device check to unlock an object that requires a move action to open, such as a door, you can immediately open that object as a free action instead. Ranged Chicanery (Disable Device 1 rank, Sleight of Hand 1 rank, ability to cast  mage hand ) : You can use  mage hand  to attempt Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks at range. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by an amount equal to 5 + 1 for every 5 feet the range is greater than 25 feet. You can\u2019t take 10 or 20 on this check. Any object manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less. If you also possess the ranged legerdemain class feature, you no longer increase the skill check DC by 5 while using Disable Device and Sleight of Hand at range.  Thunderstone Tricks Source   Adventurer's Armory 2 pg. 26 In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (thunderstone) feat to use the following tricks. Deafening Component (ability to create bombs or cast any spell with the electricity, fire, or sonic descriptor) : You can add a thunderstone as an additional material component to any spell you cast with the electricity, fire, or sonic descriptor, or to any bomb you throw. Any creature damaged by that spell or bomb must also succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 hour. Evolve Resilience (Knowledge [arcana] 1 rank, eidolon class feature) : Your eidolon can consume a thunderstone as a standard action to bolster its resilience against certain effects. For 1 hour, your eidolon gains the resistance evolution (electricity or sonic only;  Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player\u2019s Guide  61 or  Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained  36). Your eidolon cannot gain both resistances from this trick at the same time. During this time, the eidolon is immune to the effects of thunderstones. Startling Noise (Stealth 3 ranks or stalker vigilante UI  specialization) : Your thunderstones are especially effective when foes don\u2019t know they\u2019re coming. Any creature that is completely unaware of your presence takes a \u20134 penalty on saving throws against thunderstones you use and, if deafened, takes an amount of nonlethal damage equal to your number of sneak attack or hidden strike dice (if any). Thunderclap (Weapon Focus [any hammer]) : Your thunderstones enhance the concussive force of hammers you wield. This trick only works with hammers to which your Weapon Focus feat applies. As a move action, you can wedge a thunderstone in place on your hammer\u2019s striking surface. When you hit a foe with that hammer, the thunderstone detonates. You gain a +4 bonus on your saving throw against the thunderstone\u2019s effect (if necessary), and your foe takes a \u20134 penalty on its saving throw against the thunderstone\u2019s effect.  Wondrous Item Tricks Source   Dirty Tactics Toolbox pg. 19 In addition to the feat or skill prerequisites (listed in parentheses) for each of the following tricks, you must have the appropriate Equipment Trick feat. You can use these tricks with any wondrous item that can be worn in a specific magic item slot, such as the body or wrists. Aura Mastery (Use Magic Device 1 rank) : Once per day, you can choose a single school of magic represented by one of your wondrous items\u2019 auras; you treat your caster level as 1 higher when casting a single spell of that school. You can make this choice at any time during the day, but you must choose the item (and school) before casting the spell. Counter Dispelling (Spellcraft 3 ranks) : When a foe attempts a dispel check, such as via  dispel magic , against either a wondrous item that you are currently wearing or wielding or a spell effect created by such an item, you can use your ranks in Use Magic Device as the item\u2019s caster level instead of its actual caster level when calculating the dispel check DC. You must be aware of the spell that is being cast and identify it with a successful Spellcraft check in order to receive this benefit. Favored Item (Magical Aptitude) : Once per day, you can spend 1 hour practicing with a wondrous item to designate it as your favored item for that day. If the favored item functions for a specific number of rounds or minutes per day greater than 1 round or 1 minute, you increase the maximum number of rounds or minutes it can function that day by an amount equal to half your ranks in Use Magic Device (minimum 1 round).

You must have access to an alchemist\u2019s lab ( Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 76 ) in order to extract components from a haunt or creature, and you must begin extracting these components within 10\u00a0minutes of the haunt or creature\u2019s death or destruction. After 10 minutes, the components have degraded too much to be of any use to you.   Harvesting components with this feat can take several hours. Performing at least 1 minute of work extracting components from a haunt or creature prevents its material components from degrading further for 24 hours, allowing you to safely suspend and resume harvesting these components without fear of subsequent degradation. This ectoplasmic residue is portable once the extraction work begins, provided you have a vial to contain the source residue (the actual amount of residue is never much, physically, but the value of the components you can extract from the residue increases with the power of the original haunt or creature).   Each hour, attempt a Craft (alchemy) or a Knowledge (religion) check to successfully handle the residue and extract useful material. The DC for this check is equal to 15 + the CR of the haunt or creature being harvested. If you succeed at the check, you harvest 50 gp worth of components. If you fail the check by 4 or less, you can attempt to harvest those components again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the residue spoils and you cannot scavenge any more from that particular source. A single source can  yield an amount of components up to a maximum value of 50 gp per point of CR before it is depleted.   Material components harvested with Haunt Scavenger can be used in place of the material components of enchantment or necromancy spells and extracts, provided they are of equal or greater value compared to the spell\u2019s normal material components. Additionally, they can be used in place of actual gold to fund the construction of a magic item with an enchantment or necromancy aura.",

Each Hellknight order has its own unique reckoning\u2014a trial of obedience and pain (described in general on page 9 and in the Reckoning entries of the Hellknight order stat blocks throughout this book). When coupled with the necessary reflection and meditation, this reckoning takes 1 hour per day to perform. Once you have performed your order\u2019s reckoning, you gain the benefit of a special ability as indicated in the Reckoning entry for the Hellknight order to which you\u2019ve sworn allegiance. If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by the Hellknight order. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the Hellknight order\u2019s second boon. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the Hellknight order\u2019s third boon. Unless a specific duration or number of uses per day is listed in a boon\u2019s description, the boon\u2019s effects are constant.  If you ever fail to perform a daily reckoning, you lose all access to the benefits and boons granted by this feat until you next perform the reckoning.  You can take this feat only if you are associated with a Hellknight order, whether you\u2019re in training to become a Hellknight, already a member, or otherwise aligned with the order\u2014the specifics are left to you and the GM to determine. Once per year, you can change your Hellknight allegiance, but doing so requires the approval of the Hellknight order you wish to join. If you are ever cast out of the Hellknight order to which you\u2019ve sworn allegiance, you lose the benefits of this feat until you restore yourself in the Hellknights\u2019 esteem. The details of this are left to the GM\u2019s discretion.  Reckonings   Similar to an ascetic\u2019s flagellations or a paladin\u2019s atonement, Hellknight reckonings are rites of mortification a Hellknight uses to focus her mind, excise unwanted thoughts, and bring herself closer to the champion of law her order idealizes. A reckoning is typically a personal matter, performed in private by a willing, unarmored Hellknight while she meditates on some aspect of the Measure and the Chain.  Hellknights are assumed to police their own thoughts and perform reckonings as necessary. If a Hellknight doesn\u2019t regularly perform reckonings as part of her scheduled meditations, she doesn\u2019t lose any abilities or suffer negative effects\u2014however, she might be censured by her fellow Hellknights if they learn of this dereliction.   Performing a Reckoning : Performing the physical component of a reckoning typically takes 10 minutes and deals 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. A particularly righteous or conflicted Hellknight might choose to perform a longer, more extreme version of a reckoning. In this case, the reckoning deals 1d4 additional points of lethal damage. A devoted Hellknight with the Hellknight Obedience feat (see page 62) can undergo an hour-long nonlethal reckoning to gain the benefit of a special ability, in addition to boons available for those with 12, 16, or 20 Hit Dice. See the chapters on the major Hellknight orders for descriptions of their specific reckonings and the boons these provide. Additionally, Hellknights with the Hellknight Obsession feat (see page 62) who choose to deal the lethal damage to themselves can access a suite of beneficial effects. The damage a reckoning deals cannot be reduced by any damage reduction or other ability or effect. ",

Members of the Order of the Nail often install a sharp barb within their armor that deals this damage when the wearer is subject to a critical hit (see page 28); if you\u2019re struck by a critical hit while wearing such armor, using this ability doesn\u2019t require a swift action.

    ],
    "benefit": "In addition to holy water\u2019s normal uses, you can use holy water to create a variety of other effects, which are listed below. To use holy water in a particular way, you must meet the additional requirements of that effect, such as a particular feat, ranks in a specific skill, or the ability to cast a certain spell (specified after the effect\u2019s name). Unless otherwise specified, using any of these abilities consumes one vial of holy water.   Blinding Water  (Improved Precise Shot): By uttering a short prayer as swift action, you can empower a vial of holy water with blinding light. If you successfully throw that vial of holy water and land a direct hit against an undead creature by the end of your next turn, the target takes damage from the holy water as normal and also becomes blinded (Reflex DC 13 negates blindness). This even affects creatures that do not have eyes such as skeletons, but not creatures that don\u2019t rely on vision.   Concentrate Holy Water  (Craft [alchemy] 4 ranks): Through alchemical processes, you can refine multiple doses of holy water into a single hyperpotent dose. To do so, you must possess two or more flasks of holy water and you must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check that takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted time. The DC of the Craft (alchemy) check is equal to 15 + 2 \u00d7 the number of doses of holy water you are combining. For example, combining three flasks of holy water would require a successful DC 21 Craft (alchemy) check. Success means you combine all of the doses into a single concentrated flask of holy water. If you fail the check by 4 or less, the distillation process failed and must be tried again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the distillation process failed and all of the doses of holy water are wasted. The maximum number of doses of holy water you can combine is equal to half the number of ranks you possess in Craft (alchemy).  A direct hit with a flask of concentrated holy water deals 2d4 points of damage + 2 points of damage \u00d7 the number of doses of holy water used to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of where the flask hits take 1 point of damage + 1 point of damage \u00d7 the number of doses of holy water used. For example, a flask of concentrated holy water made of 3 doses of holy water would deal 2d4+6 points of damage on a direct hit, and 4 points of damage to undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of the target.   Healing Glyph  (ability to cast  glyph of warding ): You can replace the diamond material component in a  glyph of warding  spell with a vial of holy water. When you do so, you must place a  spell glyph  containing a conjuration (healing) spell of 3rd level or lower, which can be designed to benefit allies or harm undead.   Healing Water  (Heal 5 ranks): You can use holy water for curative purposes. When you pour a vial of holy water over your hands, you gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks to perform first aid, treat wounds, treat poison, or treat disease in the next hour. Additionally, once per day you can drink a vial of holy water to heal yourself of 1d8 points of damage.   Holy Circle  (ability to cast  magic circle against evil ): You can replace the silver material component of a  magic circle against evil  spell with a vial of holy water. When you do so, the duration of the spell increases 20 minutes per level instead of 10 minutes, and the Spellcraft DC to add a special diagram to the circle is 15 instead of 20.   Holy Water Splash  (Point-Blank Shot): When you throw a flask of holy water, creatures in the area of the holy water\u2019s splash radius take 1 additional point of damage as long as they are within 30 feet of you. This ability does not stack with other effects that increase the damage dealt to creatures within the splash radius of holy water, such as the concentrate holy water ability of this feat or the  empower holy water  spell on page 26.

The blast uses the Constitution modifier of whoever provided the substance infusion and the Dexterity modifier of whoever provided the form infusion. If the blast includes only one infusion, the blast uses the Constitution or Dexterity modifier of the kineticist who supplied that infusion, as appropriate for the infusion provided.

The value of these objects need not match the required cost exactly, but they cannot be less than the required costs.

Your reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower you are trying to attract) raises or lowers your Leadership score: Leader's Reputation Modifier Great renown +2 Fairness and generosity +1 Special power +1 Failure -1 Aloofness -1 Cruelty -2 Other modifiers may apply when you try to attract a cohort, as listed below. The Leader... Modifier Has a familiar, special mount, or animal companion -2 Recruits a cohort of a different alignment -1 Caused the death of a cohort -2* *Cumulative per cohort killed. Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When you try to attract a follower, use the following modifiers. The Leader... Modifier Has a stronghold, base of operations, guildhouse, etc. +2 Moves around a lot -1 Caused the death of other followers -1 Leadership Score : Your base Leadership score equals your level plus your Charisma modifier. In order to take into account negative Charisma modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but you must still be 7th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect your Leadership score, as detailed above. Cohort Level : You can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of your Leadership score, you can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than yourself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level (see Creating NPCs). A cohort can be of any race or class. The cohort's alignment may not be opposed to your alignment on either the law/chaos or good/evil axis, and you take a \u20131 penalty to your Leadership score if you recruit a cohort of an alignment different from your own. A cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party's XP. Instead, divide the cohort's level by your level. Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to you, then add that number of experience points to the cohort's total. If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than your level, the cohort does not gain the new level\u2014its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level.  Number of Followers by Level : You can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they're generally low-level NPCs. Because they're usually 5 or more levels behind you, they're rarely effective in combat. Followers don't earn experience and thus don't gain levels. When you gain a new level, consult Table: Leadership to determine if you acquire more followers, some of whom may be higher level than the existing followers. Don't consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.",

Possible Liberator Quests  d12 Quest  1 Halfling slave-liberators have asked you to meet them in a nondescript pub in Corentyn, Cheliax (page 54).  2 The child of escaped slaves held on Stonespine Island and sold in the Fleshfairs of Okeno, you dream of going to Katapesh to free others like your parents (page 93).  3 After visiting Absalom for a short time, you were stunned to find the practice of slavery so prevalent in the Coins district of that city, and now you intend to clean up the streets as best you can (page 39).  4 The Gray Corsairs need information on the defenses of several Rahadoumi slave ships they plan to raid (page 265).  5 Sedeq, slave capital of Qadira, trades in genies and elemental kin, many of whom wield magic that they might grant to those who free them (page 153).  6 Though the slaves of Molthune live better than in most other countries, their rise to full citizenship does not come fast enough for your tastes (page 123).  7 Lizardfolk raid the slave-trading town of Neruma in the Shackles with increasing frequency, providing you an opportunity to free slaves held in the town in the midst of the chaos (page 172).  8 The slave-monster battles of Greenblood in the Sodden Lands inflame your sensibilities, even if the brutes who brawl in the tournaments there are supposedly irredeemably foul creatures. Regardless, you know they suffer a fate none should behold, and are intent on freeing them (page 176).  9 There is said to be a forest in Irrisen called Chillblight, where the fey rule over their human thralls. Only the aid of an outsider can save these enslaved innocents from their icy masters (page 80).  10 While you rarely have dealings with the mongrelmen of the Darklands, rumors of hundreds of enslaved members of their kind in the underground settlement of Corgunbier pushes you to action (page 59).  11 Master of Blades and ex-slave Mardinus in Citadel Gheradesca has spouted dogma of the heights one can achieve through hard work, and you\u2019re intent to put that theory to the test when you pick his brain for the locations of other enslaved peoples (page 266).  12 Breaking out enslaved allies from the city of Hagegraf in the Darklands will be no easy task, but you\u2019re willing to risk it all for your comrades trapped in the duergar city (page 59).",

    "special": "You can select the Magic Trick feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of spell. Daylight Source   Chronicle of Legends pg. 16 Though many clerics in the church of  Sarenrae  can conjure powerful light, it was a warpriest named Amnok who learned to focus it through his shield and blind Sarenrae\u2019s foes. He later learned how to conjure a burst of pure daylight, shining like the sun for a several seconds and defeating an entire cabal of vampires. Most of the manipulations of the  daylight  spell come from Amnok\u2019s early work. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick ( daylight ) feat to use the trick. Barrier of Light ( Shield Focus ) : When you cast  daylight  on a shield, it sheds bright light in a 120-foot cone and raises the light level by one step for an additional 120 feet. As a standard action, you can end the spell by causing the light to suddenly flash, blinding each creature in the cone for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your daylight spell DC. Blades of Light (Knowledge [religion] 6 ranks) : When you cast  daylight  on a melee weapon, you can reduce the duration to 1 round per level and grant the weapon the ability to deal additional damage against undead and evil outsiders equal to 1 point per 2 caster levels (maximum +5). This extra damage does not stack with the  holy  weapon enchantment and similar effects. Burst of Sunlight (Spellcraft 6 ranks or worship deity with  Sun domain ) : You can reduce the duration of your  daylight  spell to 1 round, causing the spell to radiate the equivalent of pure daylight for the purpose of affecting creatures that are damaged, destroyed, or are otherwise affected by such light. Convincing Halo (Knowledge [religion] 3 ranks) : When you cast  daylight  on a piece of headgear, you can make it appear as a halo. This grants the creature wearing the headgear a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Bluff checks against good outsiders. Pin Sunlight ( Precise Shot ) : When you cast  daylight  on a piece of ammunition or thrown weapon, you can cause the spell to transfer to the target of a successful ranged attack with that piece of ammunition or thrown weapon, causing the creature to radiate light from its body. If the creature succeeds at a Will save against your  daylight  spell DC, it instead glows with dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 minute. Vessel of Light (no additional prerequisites) : When you cast  daylight  on a torch, lantern, or other tool used to produce mundane light, you increase the duration of your spell to 1 hour per level. Fireball Source   Chronicle of Legends pg. 16 Vincent the Pyroclastic is a destructive force in the Society. He has caused permanent damage to and condemnation of more buildings in the Inner Sea region than any other agent. For him, incineration became an art. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick ( fireball ) feat to use the trick. Alchemist\u2019s Inferno (Craft [alchemy] 9 ranks, Spellcraft 9 ranks) : Using  alchemist\u2019s fire  as a material component, your  fireball  sets everything it touches ablaze. The initial blast deals half as much damage, but targets that fail their Reflex saves also catch fire. A creature that catches fire in this way must attempt a Reflex save against the DC of the fireball spell to stop burning instead of the  typical DC . Unattended objects automatically catch fire, though nonflammable objects burn for only 1 additional round. Cluster Bomb (Spellcraft 6 ranks) : You are able to throw multiple small explosions with a single spell instead of the normal effect. For every 2 caster levels, you toss a miniature  fireball  with a 10-foot radius that deals 2d6 points of fire damage. The grid intersection of all blasts must be within 30 feet of each other. If a creature is in the area of multiple blasts, it attempts a single Reflex save against the combined damage. Concentrated Fire ( Selective Spell  or  Widen Spell , Spellcraft 6 ranks) : You can reduce the radius of your  fireball  by increments of 5 feet, to a minimum of a 5-foot radius. For each 5-foot increment you reduce the spell, you increase the spell\u2019s damage by 1d6. This additional damage can exceed the spell\u2019s maximum damage. Sculpt Flames ( Reach Spell ,  Selective Spell ) : You can alter the shape of your  fireball  to send its fire along the path you desire. When casting the spell, you can change the area to one 5-foot square per caster level. The spell\u2019s area must be continuous and unbroken when cast. If its blocked or otherwise interrupted by a 5-foot wide or larger environmental feature like a wall, the spell fails. A creature only takes damage once from a  fireball  cast in this way, even if the spell\u2019s area intersects with the creature multiple times. Where There\u2019s Smoke (Craft [alchemy] 6 ranks, Spellcraft 6 ranks) : Using a  smokestick  as a material component, you make your  fireball  leave behind a thick cloud of smoke in the spell\u2019s area for 1 minute. A moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round as a smokestick. When using a smokestick in this way, your fireball deals only 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6).   Floating Disk Source   Distant Realms pg. 62 Although most spellcasters use  floating disks  as little more than a means of moving luggage, the shulsagas of the Astral Plane have mastered the ability to ride atop a  floating disk . A combination of cultural importance, astral secrets, and constant practice allows shulsagas to push the spell\u2019s magic beyond its normal limits. Masters of the art can perform truly extraordinary maneuvers with proper training. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick ( floating disk ) feat to use the trick. Defensive Disk (Fly 3 ranks,  Shield Proficiency ) : While riding atop your  floating disk  with at least one hand free, you can spend a move action to grip the disk by its edge, tilt it, and use it to deflect blows. Until the beginning of your next turn, your  floating disk  grants you the benefits of the spell shield. If you are already under the effects of the shield spell from another source, this effect instead increases the spell\u2019s shield bonus by 1 until the beginning of your next turn. Disk Rider (Fly 3 ranks) : You can ride atop any  floating disk  you create, so long as it has the capacity to support your weight. This grants you a fly speed of 30 feet (average), but the disk cannot move itself or you more than 5 feet above the ground at any time. If you are on a location within the Astral Plane\u2014including Yulgamot itself\u2014the disk can instead fly to any height, and your fly speed while standing on it increases to 40 feet (good). When you cast  floating disk , you can step onto the disk in your space as part of the action required to cast the spell. Drifting Defense (Fly 6 ranks,  Mobility ,  Shield Proficiency ) : Whenever you move at least 10 feet during your turn, you can activate the defensive disk trick as a free action. Expanded Disk (Fly 3 ranks,  Heighten Spell ) : If you are Large or larger, you can create a larger  floating disk  capable of supporting your weight and size; however, for each size category you are larger than Medium, you must use a spell slot that is one level higher (for example, a 4th-level spell is required to create a disk capable of supporting a Gargantuan creature). Once created, a disk augmented with this trick will always support the weight of you and your personal gear, even if this combined mass exceeds the disk\u2019s capacity. Force Check (Fly 3 ranks,  Catch Off-Guard  or  Improved Bull Rush ) : When you successfully charge and bull rush a creature while riding atop your  floating disk , you can veer the disk into your target, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage in addition to moving the target. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Armor Class against any attack of opportunity attempted against you when performing a bull rush in this way. Spurn Gravity (Fly 6 ranks) : While astride your  floating disk , you can fly higher than 5 feet above the ground. However, you must return to a location 5 feet above a stable surface before the end of your turn or fall. If you take damage from this fall, you fall prone atop your  floating disk . As a swift action, you can also reduce the remaining duration of your  floating disk  to 1 round per level. For the remaining duration of the spell, your fly speed increases to 50 feet and your disk ignores all altitude limitations. Mage Hand Source   Chronicle of Legends pg. 16 Cylindia the Sly was a renowned cat burglar throughout Magnimar. Though she never had any formal magical training, her ancestor\u2019s magical blood was all she needed to produce and master the use of  mage hand . She remains unique in that her adaptations to the spell came entirely from practical applications rather than study and experimentation. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick ( mage hand ) feat to use the trick. Dirty Magic Trick (base attack bonus +1,  Improved Dirty Trick ) : You can manipulate a target\u2019s clothing or a nearby object to attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against a single opponent in the spell\u2019s range, using your combat maneuver bonus for the check. Powerful Hand (Spellcraft 3 ranks) : You can increase the weight of objects you can move by 5 pounds for every 3 ranks you have in Spellcraft. Ranged Aid (base attack bonus +1) : You\u2019ve learned to use your  mage hand  to tug at an opponent\u2019s hair, clothing, and equipment. You can use the aid another action at range, attempting a ranged touch attack instead of a melee attack. Reaching Hand ( Precise Shot  or  Reach Spell ) : You can focus as a swift action before casting  mage hand  to increase its range to 50 feet + 5 feet per caster level. If the target of your  mage hand  spell is outside of the spell\u2019s standard range at the start of your turn, you must spend another swift action to focus again or the spell immediately ends. Subtle Hand ( Deft Hands , Disable Device 6 ranks, Sleight of Hand 6 ranks) : You can attempt Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks within range of your  mage hand . Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5, and you cannot take 10 on this check. Throw Punch ( Improved Unarmed Strike ) : You can use  mage hand  to strike an opponent within the spell\u2019s range. This is a melee attack that always deals 1d3 points of force damage. The  mage hand  has an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. Spell resistance applies against this ability. Obscuring Mist Source   Chronicle of Legends pg. 17 Shastalla of the Shackles was a bloodthirsty pirate, famous for her raids on Chelish patrols under the cover of obscuring mist. After Shastalla was caught and executed, the Pathfinder Society purchased her magical library for a small fortune to learn her secrets. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick ( obscuring mist ) feat to use the trick. Clinging Mist ( Extend Spell , Spellcraft 6 ranks) : Your thick mist is difficult to escape. A creature that leaves the obscuring mist continues to treat other creatures as if they had concealment for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. Hydrating Mist (Survival 3 ranks) : Your mist clings to creatures, soaking them and their equipment. This grants each creature a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist effects of heat and a \u20134 penalty on saves against effects that deal electricity damage and spells with the electricity descriptor. This effect functions as submersion in water for aquatic creatures and penetrates the skin, hydrating creatures in the mist as if they consumed a canteen full of water. Mist Screen ( Heighten Spell ) : You can shape your  obscuring mist  into a dense wall of mist with an area up to one 10-foot square per 2 levels. The sections of wall are 5 feet thick and must remain contiguous, but they do not need to be anchored to a solid surface. At least one section of the wall must include your space. Creatures standing within the wall have concealment. Creatures on the opposite side of the wall have total concealment. Obscure Self (Stealth 6 ranks) : You reduce the area of the  obscuring mist  to your space plus all adjacent squares, but the mist is no longer stationary and instead automatically moves with you when you move. This does not create enough concealment to attempt Stealth checks. As a swift action, you can anchor the mist, causing it to become stationary and allowing enough concealment to hide. You can release the mist as a swift action, allowing it to move with you again. If you take any fire damage while this trick is in effect, the spell immediately ends. Obscure Terrain ( Selective Spell ) : Your mist rests low to the ground, blocking sight to all underfoot and making the area difficult to traverse. Your obscuring mist takes up the same area, but no longer blocks sight of other creatures. Instead, all creatures moving through the mist treat the area as difficult terrain. A creature can spend a move action to treat the area as normal terrain until the end of its turn. Quenching Mist (Spellcraft 6 ranks or  water subtype ) : You can issue a forceful blast of pressurized mist in a 15-foot cone instead of casting  obscuring mist  normally. This blast automatically quenches any nonmagical fires and functions as  dispel magic  against magical fires as long as those fires are Medium or smaller. The duration changes to instantaneous and the spell gains the water descriptor. Creatures with the fire subtype within the cone take 1d6 points of damage for every 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6) you have (half on a successful Reflex save). Prestidigitation Source   Chronicle of Legends pg. 17 Though magical practitioners around the multiverse make daily use of  prestidigitation , Poshment the Peculiar was the first to dabble in  prestidigitation's  many possibilities. Through dedicated study and dubious field tests, he was able to find many more uses than dying his clothes and cleaning up a spell component closet. By the time he had graduated from the Arcanamirium in Absalom, he had already learned to permanently dye clothes and even paint on canvas using only his spellwork. Over the years, he expanded  prestidigitation  from a multi-use spell to a work of art. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick ( prestidigitation ) feat to use the trick. Adjust Scent (Survival 6 ranks) : You can adjust the smell of an object or willing creature to become more or less powerful, respectively doubling or reducing by half the distance needed to detect the target with the  scent  universal monster ability. Chromatic Savant (Disguise 3 ranks or  gnome ) : When you change the color of an item, the changes are permanent. You can also change the color of part or all of a living being, but the effect gradually fades away in about a month. You must succeed at an appropriate Craft check to create complex or specific designs. Lasting Changes ( Extend Spell ) : The effects of your  prestidigitation  spells persist for 1 hour per caster level; this does not change its spell level. Minor Levitation (Spellcraft 3 ranks) : You can cause up to 1 pound of material to become weightless and direct it to move up to 5 feet each round as if under the effects of  levitate . Repulsive Flavor (Craft [cooking] 3 ranks) : You can cause a willing creature to taste foul. Once a creature with a bite attack successfully attacks the target of your spell, the target gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and CMD against bite attacks and grapple checks made with a mouth, such as the  grab  ability or  swallow whole , from that creature. Thaumaturgic Aesthetics (Bluff 3 ranks, Disguise 3 ranks,  Deceptive ) : While you have a  prestidigitation  spell active, you can thematically change the effects of other spells you cast, such as changing the color of a  fireball , granting your  magic missile  a specific shape, or adding a floral smell to your  mage armor . This increases the DC of Spellcraft and Knowledge (arcana) checks to identify your magic by an amount equal to half of your ranks in Disguise (minimum 1). Shield Source   Chronicle of Legends pg. 19 Kah\u2019la is one of the more studious magi to ever graduate from the Arcanamirium. Though her professors had hoped she would make a fine magical theoretician, she joined the Pathfinder Society and put her theories on abjuration to good use. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parenthesis for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick ( shield ) feat to use the trick. Friendly Shield ( Bodyguard ) : When using the  Bodyguard  feat, you can instead grant your ally the benefit of your active  shield  spell. You lose the spell\u2019s benefits and your ally gains these benefits for the spell\u2019s duration. Force Bash ( Improved Bull Rush ,  Improved Shield Bash ) : While the  shield  spell is active, as a standard action you can cause your  shield  to fly toward a target within 30 feet and attempt to bash it. On a successful ranged attack roll, the spell deals 1d8 points of force damage plus 1 point per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). If it deals damage, you can also attempt a bull rush combat maneuver with the shield as a free action. The  shield  has an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. Using the  shield  in this way consumes 1 minute of the spell\u2019s duration. Spell resistance applies against this ability. Force Equipment ( Equipment Trick [shield] ) : You can use your  shield  spell with the  Equipment Trick (shield)  feat for the following tricks: Break Ground, Hurl Shield, Little Wall, Ricochet Shield, Shield Gag. Instant Cover (Spellcraft 6 ranks) : While the  shield  spell is active, as an immediate action you can expand your shield into a  tower shield  made of force. Choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as a  wall of force , except for each 2 caster levels it has hardness 5 and 5 hit points. At the end of the current creature\u2019s turn, the  shield  spell immediately ends. Reflective Shield (Spellcraft 9 ranks) : While the  shield  spell is active, as an immediate action you can reflect  magic missile  spells back on their caster as if using  spell turning . Using the shield in this way consumes 1 minute of the spell\u2019s duration. Unseen Servant Source   Chronicle of Legends pg. 19 Who better than Seganam, a conjuration professor at Korvosa\u2019s Acadamae, to discover a variety of applications for  unseen servant . Originally he modified the spell to assist with his alchemical experiments, but over time he learned to make these servants function in a variety of ways. Today, armor-clad servants stand perpetual guard outside his office. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick ( unseen servant ) feat to use the trick. Phantom Decoy (Disguise 6 ranks) : Your servant can inhabit a suit of armor as if wearing it, appearing as haunted armor. This reduces the  unseen servant\u2019s  movement speed as normal armor would. Attacks against the  unseen servant  target an AC equal to 10 plus the armor bonus from the armor. Any successful attack damages the armor as if it were targeted by a sunder combat maneuver. An area effect that deals 6 or more points of damage destroys the  unseen servant  as usual. Unfettered Servant ( Reach Spell ) : Without increasing the spell slot, you increase the range of your  unseen servant  to long. If the servant moves beyond the spell\u2019s range, it finishes its current task before it ceases to exist. Unseen Apprentice ( Combat Casting , Spellcraft 3 ranks) : You servant is gifted with a spark of magical prowess. If the servant is adjacent to you when you attempt a concentration check, you gain a +1 bonus to the check. This bonus increases to +2 when you have 10 or more ranks in Spellcraft. Unseen Assistant (Craft [any], Perform [any], or Profession [any] 3 ranks) : You infuse your servant with the spirit of creativity. It can assist you as if successfully using the aid another action with a single Craft, Profession, or Perform skill in which you have 3 or more ranks. Alternatively, it can use any of these skills itself, using half of your total bonus for that skill. Unseen Squire (armor proficiency) : Your servant can assist any character in donning armor with which you are proficient. When doing so, that character is considered as having help to don her armor and can do so in half the usual time: 5 rounds for light armor, 1 minute for medium armor, or 2 minutes for heavy armor. Unseen Warrior (base attack bonus +3) : You imbue your servant with the spirit of battle, reducing the duration to 1 round per level but allowing it to take aid another actions in battle on your turn. The servant has an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifiers.  "

After this ritual, you forever lose all names and identities previously associated with you (including any identities that you gain from class abilities). You adopt a brief descriptive title in place of a new name. Your title must not reference the names of any people or places.

While you\u2019re wearing this mask, any attempts to scry or otherwise locate any of your eschewed identities or connect you to those identities do not work, revealing nothing but darkness, as if you were an invalid target or did not exist. Successful Knowledge checks to identify you reveal your new title rather than any old identity, but can reveal your strengths and weaknesses normally.  As long as you wear the ritual mask and do not reveal your connection to any past identities, any attempt to scry on you in relation to of your eschewed identities requires a successful caster level check with a DC of 10 + your Hit Dice. In addition, you are immune to effects that require the use of your name, such as the  named bullet UC  spell. While benefiting from this feat, you cannot wear any magic items in the head slot, as the mask used by this effect effectively occupies this slot (though this feat\u2019s benefits are not magical for the purpose of  dispel magic  and other effects).

You also gain an additional benefit depending on which family you belong to.  Basri : You come from the long line of ambassadors, diplomats, and travelers that make up the Basri, and your family maintains the strongest ties to the elven nation of Kyonin of any Taldan humans. Select one of the following as a bonus starting language: Celestial, Elven, Gnome, Sylvan. You gain proficiency in one of the following weapons: longbow (including composite), longsword, rapier, or shortbow (including composite). If you gain proficiency in all martial weapons at 1st level, you can instead select elven curve blade.  Clement : Your Garundi and Mwangi ancestors served Taldor proudly during the Sixth Army of Exploration and were awarded titles for their service. Your family, which has maintained their noble titles to this day, is known for keen insights and biting observations. You can substitute your Wisdom modifier for your Charisma modifier when attempting Diplomacy skill checks.  Corcina : Your family came to prominence during the Second Army of Exploration, and maintains a legacy as explorers and sailors. You gain a +1 bonus on Climb and Escape Artist checks, and a +2 bonus on Survival checks to navigate.  Karthis : Yours is a family of distinguished military veterans, charismatic demagogues, and xenophobic zealots. As the rest of the family becomes increasingly Imperialist, you have made no effort to remain in their good graces, but you retain the skills they taught you during a childhood of rigorous training. You can apply your Charisma modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier to Initiative checks.  Kastner : Your stalwart family defines itself by opposing your devil-worshiping Chelish cousins, a grudge that inspired some of Taldor\u2019s greatest healers, priests, and negotiators. You gain one additional use per day of channel energy, lay on hands, or mesmerist tricks, or 3 additional rounds of bardic music per day. You gain only one of these benefits, even if you later acquire a second class that provides one of the other class features listed.  Lotheed : Your family ranks include the greatest wizards and arcane scholars in Taldor, and schooling in some of the most comprehensive arcane libraries in the Inner Sea was your birthright. If your Intelligence is 11 or higher, you gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day\u2014 dancing lights ,  prestidigitation ,  read magic ,  unseen servant . The caster level for these effects is equal to one-half your class level.  Merosett : The cunning members of your large family, a longtime fixture in Oppara\u2019s bureaucracy, specialize in tracking lineages and sidestepping red tape. You gain a +5 bonus on Bluff checks to send secret messages and Sense Motive checks to discern secret messages. You halve the time required to search through archives, navigate government offices, review contracts, or otherwise work with the complex bureaucracies your family has mastered for generations.  Stavian : As a close relative of the Grand Prince, yours has been a life of material comfort and indulgence, colored by constant threats and direct influence. You gain a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves against poison and on Will saves against enchantment spells of the charm and compulsion subschools.  Talbot : Your starkly conservative family are merchants and entrepreneurs first and aristocrats second, willing to forgo duty if they can instead pursue profit. They condemn would-be adventurers and readily oust them from the family ranks, leaving you an outcast. You gain a +2 bonus on one Profession skill of your choice. Once per day, you can use this Profession skill in place of a single Knowledge skill check.  Varima : Your family immigrated to Taldor from Vudra hundreds of years ago, and thanks to noble roots, extensive trade contacts, and an unparalleled skill in negotiation, soon developed into a steadfast fixture of Oppara\u2019s social scene. Whenever you use Diplomacy to influence a crowd or a room (but not individuals), you can roll twice and use the better result.  Vernisant : Your family is descended from the great general Arnisant, who commanded Taldan forces during the Shining Crusade... and they will never let anyone forget it! Their fierce Imperialist support and nationalist fervor has left you alienated from your relatives now, but their emphasis on scholarship left a mark nonetheless. You gain a +1 bonus on all Knowledge skills in which you have at least 1 rank.  Vinmark : Newcomers and outsiders, your Ulfen family was exalted to nobility 19 years ago, when Stavian III promoted your family patriarch to Baron of Oppara as a reward for service in the Ulfen Guard. Established aristocrats consider your family crude, choosing to leave them on the margins of Taldan politics unless a noble thinks they could use you to curry favor with the Grand Prince, but hard-won practicality and newborn cynicism grant you insight most Taldan nobles lack. Once per day when rolling a Sense Motive check, you may roll two dice and use the better result.  Zespire : Your family runs charities and lobbies heavily for social reform, leaving them with few friends among their Opparan peers but heartfelt support from the common folk and lesser nobility. You gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Perform checks when dealing with common citizens and with nobles whose titles are limited to Lord, Lady, Knight, or Dame.",

Each affected creature can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) to take half damage. This negative energy damage does not heal undead.

To notice a soulgate that you\u2019re not already familiar with, you must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check\u2014this DC could be higher if the portal is obscured or damaged, or at the GM\u2019s discretion. If the soulgate shares your exact alignment, you gain a +5 bonus on your check to notice the portal, feeling an instinctual draw toward it. If your alignment and the portal\u2019s share none of the same components, you take a \u20135 penalty on your check to notice the portal.

Check : Once you are aware of a soulgate, you can use your knowledge of the planes and your place as a child of the multiverse to attempt to open the portal. This attempt takes 1 minute to perform. The DC of the Knowledge (planes) check to open a soulgate is 30. If your alignment perfectly matches that of the soulgate, you gain a +5 bonus on this check. You can also attempt to open a soulgate with an alignment that is within one step of your own. However, unless you are neutral, you cannot open a soulgate with an alignment two or more steps away from your own.  For example, a lawful evil character would gain a +5 bonus on her attempt to open a soulgate connecting the Material Plane to Hell (lawful evil) or other planes of lawful evil alignment. She can also attempt to open soulgates to Abaddon (neutral evil), Axis (lawful neutral), and other planes that share those planes\u2019 alignments, because their alignments are one step away from lawful evil. She can never open a soulgate to the Abyss (chaotic evil), the Boneyard (neutral), Elysium (chaotic good), Heaven (lawful good), the Maelstrom (chaotic neutral), Nirvana (neutral good), or any other plane with those alignments.  If your alignment is neutral with no other alignment components, you can open soulgates with an alignment two steps away from your own, but you take a \u201310 penalty on attempts to do so.  Once opened, you can keep a soulgate open for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. An open soulgate closes at the end of that time, or you can close it earlier as a standard action."

When casting a spell, you can perform the steps below to spontaneously apply the effects of either or both of these metamagic feats, as well as any other metamagic feats you have, to the spell without expending a higher-level spell slot. Using a feat in this way increases the spell\u2019s casting time to the casting time it would take if the character were a sorcerer or bard (sorcerers and bards using this ability increase the spell\u2019s casting time by two categories; see page 113 of the  Core Rulebook ); applying the Quicken Spell metamagic effect negates the increased casting time but still contributes to the modified spell\u2019s effective spell level. You can take this feat more than once; each time, select two additional metamagic feats, adding their effects to the list of possible effects you can apply to spells with this ability.  When casting a spell using Sacred Geometry, first determine the effective spell level of the modified spell you are attempting to cast (calculated as normal for a spell modified by metamagic feats). You can apply any number of metamagic effects to a single spell, provided you are able to cast spells of the modified spell\u2019s effective spell level.   Effective Spell Level Prime Constants   1st 3, 5, 7   2nd 11, 13, 17   3rd 19, 23, 29   4th 31, 37, 41   5th 43, 47, 53   6th 59, 61, 67   7th 71, 73, 79   8th 83, 89, 97   9th 101, 103, 107  Refer to the Prime Constants table to determine the prime constants that can be used to cast a spell of the desired effective spell level. Then roll a number of d6s equal to the number of ranks you possess in Knowledge (engineering). Perform some combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division upon the numbers rolled that gives rise to one of the relevant prime constants. If you can produce one of the relevant prime constants, the spell takes effect with the declared metamagic effects, and you expend a spell slot of the unaltered spell\u2019s level. If you are unsuccessful, you fail to cast the spell, the action used to cast the spell is lost, and the spell slot is used up. The DC of any concentration check to cast a spell affected by this feat uses the effective spell level used to determine the prime constants, even though a successful casting of the spell does not expend a higher-level spell slot.  For example, suppose Ezren wants to add the enlarged and empowered effects to the  magic missile  he just cast. He adds the total level increases of the metamagic effects to the spell level: 2 [empower] + 1 [enlarge] + 1 [ magic missile \u2019s base level] = 4, so the spell\u2019s effective level is 4. Ezren refers to the Prime Constants table, and determines that the prime constants for that effective spell level are 31, 37, and 41.  Since Ezren has 5 ranks in Knowledge (engineering), he rolls 5d6. The results of his dice pool are 6, 6, 4, 3 and 1. He then performs the following operations to give rise to one of the prime constants he needs: (6 \u00d7 6) + (4 \u2013 3) \u00d7 1 = 37. Note that he could also combine the numbers as follows: ([6 + 6] \u00d7 3) + 4 + 1 = 41. He has produced one of the prime constants for the desired effective spell level, so his  empowered enlarged magic missile  takes effect after the full-round casting time, and uses only a 1st-level spell slot.

The soul can be captured in any way (the spells  create soul gem ,  soul trap , and  trap the soul  are the most common methods), but you must be able to touch the soul or the object in which it is trapped (usually a crystal or gem) to use it as a material component. Using a soul in this way does not harm the object in which it was trapped. The soul itself must be at least equal in value to the gp cost of the material component you are replacing (any excess gp value is lost). See the section blow for the gp values of various souls.  A soul used as a material component is damaged but not destroyed. Once used, such a soul is no longer trapped and cannot be used as a material component again. A creature whose soul has been used as a material component cannot be restored to life via  raise dead .  Reincarnate ,  resurrection , and  true resurrection  can restore such a creature to life if the caster succeeds at a DC 20 caster level check.  Miracle  and  wish  can restore the creature to life without requiring a caster level check. Using Soul-Powered Magic is an evil act.  The Value of Souls  Trapped souls are one of the fundamental currencies throughout Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell. Three key factors influence a soul's value in the soul trade: the strength of the soul's life force (which relates directly to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested), the soul's age (how long the soul has been cycled through reincarnation, which directly relates to the sapience of the creature from which the soul was harvested), and the soul's flavor (which is determined by factors that include the alignment, personality, and religion of the creature from which the soul was harvested). Of course, it's worth noting that while trading in souls may prove lucrative, the practice is undeniably evil and an affront to the natural order, and thus it is considered to be an evil act unless one is trading souls for an altruistic purpose (such as to smash purchased prisons and release the souls trapped within).  Life Force : A soul's life force sets its base gp value. This is equal to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested \u00d7 1,000. Thus, the base value of a CR 1 creature's soul is 1,000 gp, while the base value of a CR 20 creature's soul is 20,000 gp.   Age : A soul from a creature who in life had an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 2 or less (including the lack of a score at all in one of those categories, and regardless of how high the other ability scores were) is less refined and younger in age, and as such is worth half its base value. Thus, the soul of a CR 1 animal with an Intelligence of 1 is worth 500 gp, while the soul of a CR 20 vermin with no intelligence score at all would be worth 10,000 gp.   Flavor : As a general rule, a soul's flavor has no direct impact on its gp value for the purposes of functioning as a material component or raw materials for magic item creation, but in certain circumstances subject to the GM's discretion, the soul's flavor can halve or double its final value. For example, a paladin's soul might have double its normal value to a daemon who finds lawful good souls to be particularly delicious, while the soul of a devout worshiper of  Desna  might be worth only half as much when used to create a magic item designed to be particularly deadly when used against chaotic good creatures, since such a soul would inherently resist being used in such a way.",

She cannot multiclass, though she may take any archetype she qualifies for, including those from the following \u201cSquire Archetypes\u201d section.  If a squire gains enough XP to bring her to two levels lower than your level, the squire does not gain the new level until you gain your next level\u2014until then her new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level and she gains no additional XP until you advance.  If you release your squire from service, you may gain a new one by scouting for potential candidates in a city or large town where members of your knightly order can typically be found, which requires at least 24 hours of uninterrupted scouting. This act can also replace a squire who has perished.   Graduation : When you reach 7th level, this feat automatically upgrades to the Leadership feat (meaning that you effectively lose this feat and replace it with Leadership). You gain all the normal benefits of the Leadership feat, except that your squire must remain at least three levels lower than you and must continue to take levels in her first class. In order for your squire to be able to be two levels lower than you, your squire must be at least 4th level, and you must witness her as she single-handedly defeats a creature with Hit Dice equal to or greater than her own. Upon the creature\u2019s defeat, your squire graduates to full knighthood and acts as a normal cohort; she may begin taking levels in other classes if she so chooses, and she may increase in level to up to two levels lower than yourself.",

    "benefit": "A stylized spell has slightly different verbal and somatic components than normal, and the spell effect appears noticeably different. The Spellcraft DC to identify a stylized spell as it is being cast is 10 higher than normal. The Knowledge (arcana) DC to identify a stylized spell, its effects, or the materials it creates is 10 higher than normal, as is the DC to recognize your magical signature with  greater detect magic . When you apply this feat to a spell, you can attempt to disguise your stylized spell as another spell of the same school and subschool with the same descriptors. The other spell must be either the same spell level as the stylized spell (before applying the metamagic adjustment) or 1 spell level higher. If you do so, the stylized spell gains the ruse descriptor (see page 192) and takes on some superficial aspects of the other spell. As usual for a spell with the ruse descriptor, identification attempts that fail by 10 or less mistakenly identify it as the chosen spell (those that fail by more can\u2019t identify it at all). A stylized spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell\u2019s actual level. Stylized Magic Source:   Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 16  When a spellcaster casts a spell modified by the Stylized Spell UI  metamagic feat, she can reduce the DC of the Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify the spell by 5 to disguise the spell in one of the following ways.   Apparent Descriptor : A stylized spell can appear to have a descriptor it lacks or appear to lack a descriptor it truly has. Changing an apparent energy descriptor changes the superficial manifestation of the energy in the spell effect but does not change the type of damage the spell deals. If the energy damages any creatures or objects, an observer who succeeds at a DC 15 Knowledge (arcana) or Perception check as a move action can identify the actual type of damage dealt based on sensory clues.   Apparent School : A stylized spell can appear to be of a different school or subschool when studied with  detect magic .   Apparent Source of Magic : A stylized spell can appear to be a different type of magic\u2014arcane, divine, or psychic. The effect is convincing only if the spellcaster provides any necessary components (such as a divine focus when imitating divine spells), and the caster must have a number of ranks in the skill associated with that type of magic equal to the spell\u2019s level. Knowledge (arcana) and Perform are associated with arcane magic, Knowledge (nature and religion) are associated with divine magic, and Bluff and Knowledge (arcana) are associated with psychic magic. A spellcaster can disguise his spell as psychic magic only if he can hide or remove the spell\u2019s verbal and somatic components (if any), such as with Conceal Spell ( Ultimate Intrigue 80 ), Secret Signs ( Pathfinder Campaigner Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 288 ), Silent Spell, or Still Spell.   Direction of Spell\u2019s Effect : A stylized spell effect that visibly originates from the caster (such as a ray, magic missile, or fireball bead) can instead appear to originate from another point within 30 feet of the caster. There must be clear lines of effect between each of the caster, the new origin point, and the destination. If the spell effect instead fills an area that originates from the caster (such as a line or cone), the effect can instead appear to originate from any point in that area. The new point of origin is entirely cosmetic, and it does not allow the spellcaster to ignore cover or other barriers. In addition, the deception can\u2019t make it appear that another creature cast the spell.   Imitate a Dissimilar Spell : If a stylized spell appears to be of the same school and same source of magic, and to have the same descriptors as another spell because of other stylized spell modifications or changes from other sources (such as a class ability), the stylized spell can take on the superficial visual and auditory properties of the other spell.   Suppress Audible or Visible Effects : A stylized spell\u2019s effects can be suppressed to the point where they are difficult to spot or hear. Such a spell\u2019s audible and visual effects are largely transparent, quieter, smaller, or otherwise less obtrusive. A creature notices the suppressed effects only if it succeeds at a Perception check (DC = 10 + your number of ranks in Bluff or Spellcraft + the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma modifiers). If, at the GM\u2019s discretion, a spell\u2019s effects are intrinsically bound to its visual or auditory signature (such as  sunburst, sound burst , and most spells with the language-dependent, light, or sonic descriptors), reduce the DC of the Perception by 10.

A melee symbolic bolt requires a melee touch attack that doesn\u2019t provoke attacks of opportunity, and a ranged symbolic bolt is a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet. A symbolic bolt deals damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 your total number of ranks in the Use Magic Device skill. You choose the type of damage dealt by your symbolic bolt each time you use this feat from those offered by the cleric domains granted by the deity whose holy symbol you use. The types of damage (and the cleric domains that grant them) are acid (Earth, Magic, Rune), cold (Darkness, Magic, Rune, Void, Water, Weather), electricity (Air, Magic, Rune, Weather), fire (Destruction, Fire, Magic, Rune), negative energy (Death, Destruction, Void), positive energy (Glory, Healing, Repose, Sun), sonic (Magic, Rune, Weather), and untyped (any). If a symbolic bolt is used to deal untyped damage, the bolt\u2019s damage is reduced to an amount equal to 1d3 + 1/2 your total number of ranks in Use Magic Device.  When you create a symbolic bolt, it originates from the hand holding the holy symbol and appears only briefly, so you have a hand free anytime you\u2019re not attacking with a symbolic bolt. The feat Weapon Focus (ray) doesn\u2019t apply to symbolic bolts, but you can take the feat Weapon Focus (symbolic bolt) and apply it to both melee and ranged symbolic bolts. Spells that target a single weapon (such as magic weapon) can\u2019t affect symbolic bolts, nor can a symbolic bolt have magic weapon special abilities.

Thus, if you or an ally is on the opposite side of the target, it is considered flanking. Normally the area must contain an illusory creature of Small or Medium size. However, you can select one square of a larger illusory creature to threaten the target. For example, an illusory Large ogre takes up four 5-foot squares; you select one square to be the source of the threat, and its other three squares do not threaten anyone. If the target has reason to believe there is an invisible creature in the vicinity, even an auditory illusion with no visual elements (such as  ghost sound ) is sufficient to convince the target that the selected square contains an actual threat. As long as you maintain the illusion, you can change the location of the threatening square as a swift action.

A torchbearer can take levels in the alchemist, bard, fighter, ranger, or rogue class. She can\u2019t multiclass, though she can take any archetype she qualifies for, including those from the Torchbearer Archetypes section on page 21. The torchbearer must take the Torch Handling feat at 1st level (see the sidebar on page 21).  If a torchbearer gains enough XP to bring her to 2 levels lower than your level, she doesn\u2019t gain the new level until you gain your next level; until then her new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level and she gains no additional XP until you advance.  If you release your torchbearer from service or otherwise lose your torchbearer, you may gain a new one by scouting for potential candidates in a city or large town where adventurers are at least somewhat common, which requires 24 hours of uninterrupted scouting.  Unlike other hirelings, a torchbearer requires no compensation for her services as long as her employer has this feat; the opportunity to train under a hardened adventurer is reward enough for most torchbearers.   Graduation : When you reach 8th level, this feat automatically upgrades to the Leadership feat (meaning that you effectively lose this feat and replace it with Leadership). You gain all the normal benefits of the Leadership feat but lose the benefits of this feat, and your torchbearer acts as a normal cohort; she may begin taking levels in other classes if she so chooses, and may increase in level to up to 2 levels lower than your level.",

The potion can still be consumed normally, but it can also be delivered by throwing it at another creature as a splash weapon. The potion vial has a range increment of 10 feet and is considered an improvised weapon. On impact, the vial breaks and a cloud of barely visible potion vapor fills the square it lands in (this vapor does not obscure normal sight in any way). If a creature is in that square, it gains the benefits of the potion immediately as though it had imbibed the potion.  Otherwise, the vapor persists for 1d3+1 rounds in only that square before dissipating, and the first creature to enter the square before the vapor dissipates gains the potion\u2019s benefits. A creature entering the vapor\u2019s space can hold its breath to refrain from inhaling the potion. No more than one creature can benefit from a potion\u2019s vapor, and if more than one creature is in the potion\u2019s space after it is thrown, the potion is wasted and has no effect. The thrown potion deals no damage to creatures or objects it hits. A spell brewed into a potion this way does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell\u2019s actual level. Versatile Brewing The above feat allows potion brewers to concoct unusual variations in their potions, altering the potions\u2019 effects in strange and useful ways. This feat functions similarly to metamagic feats, though it affects the creation of potions instead of the normal casting of spells.

When wearing a different prayer scroll, you gain its special abilities, but lose your normal prayer scroll\u2019s immunity to spell completion and spell trigger magic items. Your prayer scrolls can be used only by you, and have no effect when used by other jiang-shis. When you choose this feat, select one of the following prayer scroll types.   Embalmed Form : This prayer scroll alters your physical form to how you looked 1 day before your death. Treat this as an  alter self  spell that affects you regardless of your original or current type; your caster level is equal to your Hit Dice. Your speed increases by 10 feet, but you lose your immunity to trip attacks and your ability to move through difficult terrain unhindered. These effects persist indefinitely as long as you wear the prayer scroll, but end immediately if you use a different prayer scroll or 24 hours after you remove this prayer scroll.   Enduring Dust : If you crumble into dust from hit point damage, you reform after 1 round instead of 1 minute. Scattering your dust does not prevent you from reforming as long none of your dust is more than 30 feet from any other part of your dust. Storing a portion of your dust in an air-tight container prevents you from reforming. If you are unable to reform after 1 minute, you are destroyed.   Positive Energy Immunity : You become immune to positive channeled energy used to harm undead. This does not protect you against positive energy from other sources such as cure spells or lay on hands.   Spell Immunity : The prayer scroll grants you immunity to a spell, as if you were using  spell immunity . You decide which spell when you create the prayer scroll, and can choose a different spell each time you create a new spell immunity prayer scroll. If you have 15 or more Hit Dice, this functions as  greater spell immunity . Creating this type of prayer scroll costs 100 gp \u00d7 the spell level of the spell keyed to the scroll.",

One-Handed Weapon Tricks Source   Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 8 These weapon tricks are common among the Aldori swordlords and many weapon masters of Tian Xia. You can use these tricks only while wearing light or no armor, wielding a light or one-handed manufactured weapon in one hand, and holding nothing in your off hand. Free Hand Maneuver (base attack bonus +6) : As a full-round action, you can make a single attack with your weapon and attempt to perform a dirty trick APG , disarm, drag APG , reposition APG , or steal APG  combat maneuver with your free hand, taking no penalties for two-weapon fighting. The combat maneuver provokes attacks of opportunities as normal, unless you have an appropriate ability or feat. You are not considered unarmed for this maneuver, but can\u2019t apply any benefits of your weapon to the combat maneuver check. Mindful Dodge ( Dodge ) : As an immediate action, you can gain a +4 dodge bonus to your AC against a single of which attack you are aware. You must make this decision before the attack roll is revealed. You are staggered on your next turn. Strike and Seize ( Improved Disarm , base attack bonus +6) : As a standard action, you can make a single attack with your weapon and attempt to perform a disarm combat maneuver with your free hand, taking no penalties for two-weapon fighting. Stylish Riposte ( Combat Reflexes , base attack bonus +4) : When your AC exceeds the result of a foe\u2019s melee attack against you by 5 or more, that foe provokes an attack of opportunity from you. Once you make such an attack of opportunity against a foe, you can\u2019t again use this trick against the foe that day. Grab and Stab ( Improved Grapple , base attack bonus +6) :  Martial Arts Handbook pg. 13  As a standard action, you can initiate a grapple with your free hand (taking the usual \u20134 penalty for not having two hands free). If the attempt is successful, you can immediately follow up with an attack using your light or one-handed weapon as a free action. If you do so, you can\u2019t use any other abilities that are triggered by a successful grapple combat maneuver check (such as constrict). The grapple attempt provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless you have an ability or feat that prevents this. Switch Hands ( Improved Feint ) :  Martial Arts Handbook pg. 14  As a free action, you can pass a light or one-handed weapon you are wielding to your free hand. If you attempt a feint during the same round, you gain a +2 bonus on your Bluff check. Once you have used this weapon trick against a target, you can\u2019t gain the bonus against the same creature until 24 hours have passed.  Polearm Tricks Source   Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 8 These weapon tricks are common in southern Garund and parts of Iobaria and Arcadia. You can use these tricks only while wielding a weapon from the polearm weapon group. Choke Up (Acrobatics 1 rank, Climb 1 rank) : You can take a \u20132 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls until the beginning of your next turn in order to choke up on and wield a two-handed polearm sized for you in one hand, as long as you do not make attacks with your other hand. Close Sweep ( Improved Bull Rush ,  Improved Reposition , or  Improved Trip ) : You can attempt a bull rush, reposition APG , or trip combat maneuver check (one for which you have the matching prerequisite feat) against an adjacent foe, even if wielding a weapon with the reach quality. Haft Bash ( Weapon Focus ) : You can accept a \u20132 penalty on attack rolls with a reach polearm for which you have Weapon Focus in order to treat the weapon as if it lacked the reach quality until the start of your next turn. If you do, the polearm functions as a club. Any qualities (such as trip) or special abilities (such as keen) of the weapon that a club could not have, and any feats or abilities you can\u2019t apply to a club, don\u2019t apply to attacks with the weapon during this time. Polearm Balance (Acrobatics 10 ranks) : You can use a polearm to improve your balance. Any round in which you do not make a melee attack, you can take 10 on an Acrobatics check even when distraction would normally prevent you from doing so. Quick Brace (base attack bonus +6) : While taking a ful-lattack action with a polearm with brace, you can ready an attack with the polearm in place of your final attack. The readied attack uses the attack bonus of the attack you used to ready it. Pole Vault (Acrobatics 3 ranks) :  Martial Arts Handbook pg. 14  You gain a +4 bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump, and you count as having a running start if you move at least 5 feet before jumping. Ranged Weapon Tricks Source   Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 8 These weapon tricks are common among the Chernasardo Rangers of Fangwood and the archers trained by House Narikopolus in Cheliax. You can use these tricks while wielding a ranged weapon. Hindering Shot ( Precise Shot ,  Snap Shot ) : You can distract a foe at a crucial moment, making it vulnerable to your allies\u2019 abilities. You can ready an action to make a ranged attack against a foe when an ally forces the foe to attempt a saving throw. If your attack hits the foe and deals damage, the foe takes a \u20134 penalty on the saving throw that triggered your readied action. Suppressing Shot (Far Shot, Precise Shot) : You can cover an ally\u2019s momentary vulnerability. You can ready an action to make a ranged attack against a foe when it makes an attack of opportunity. If your attack hits and damages the foe, the foe\u2019s attack of opportunity automatically misses its target.  Two-Handed Weapon Tricks Source   Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 9 These weapon tricks are known to dwarves of the Five Kings Mountains and Shoanti champions of the Cinderlands. You can use these tricks while wielding any two-handed weapon. Cleaving Smash ( Cleave ,  Improved Vital Strike ,  Power Attack ) : When you use Cleave, you can add the additional damage from Vital Strike to both your initial and your secondary attacks. If you also have the Greater Vital Strike feat, you can instead add the damage from Improved Vital Strike to both your initial and your secondary attacks. Crush Armor ( Improved Sunder ,  Power Attack ) : When you deal damage to a foe\u2019s armor with a successful sunder combat maneuver check while using a two-handed weapon, the foe must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your base attack bonus + your Strength modifier) or be fatigued for 1 round. If the armor has the broken condition after you damage it, the foe must continue making this save every round until he removes the armor or the armor loses the broken condition. If the armor is destroyed by your sunder attempt, the foe is automatically fatigued for 1 round. The foe cannot become exhausted this way. Two-Handed Menace (Intimidate 5 ranks) : Capitalizing on the fear inspired by massive weapons, you can take 10 on Intimidate checks even when distracted or in combat. Warding Weapon ( Combat Expertise ) : While you are using the total defense action, fighting defensively, or using Combat Expertise, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC. One-Handed Lunge (base attack bonus +6) :  Martial Arts Handbook pg. 14  As a standard action, you can release one of your hands holding a two-handed weapon and make a melee attack with the weapon, increasing your reach by 5 feet for the duration of the attack. If the attack hits, you deal damage as if using a one-handed weapon, adding only your Strength bonus to damage if you are using your primary hand or half your Strength bonus if you are using your off hand, instead of 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus. Otherwise, you take no penalty for using the weapon one-handed. The extra reach doesn\u2019t stack with the  Lunge  feat or other effects that extend your melee reach beyond that granted by your size category.  Two-Weapon Tricks Source   Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 9 These weapon tricks are common among the pirates of the Shackles, the Shoanti, and natives of Northern Casmaron and Garund. You can use these tricks only while wielding two weapons. Arm Bind ( Two-Weapon Defense ,  Two-Weapon Fighting ) : You can attempt a combat maneuver check to disarm a foe even if the foe has no weapons. This functions as the disarm combat maneuver. If you succeed and the foe has no weapon, you ensnare an arm of your choice, preventing your foe from using that limb until the end of your next turn. A foe can take a standard action to free its arm. Dual Strike ( Double Slice ,  Improved Vital Strike ) : As a standard action, you can make two attacks, one with each weapon you\u2019re wielding, applying the normal penalties for two-weapon fighting to each. Off-Hand Opportunity ( Combat Reflexes ) : You can make one additional attack of opportunity each round with your off-hand weapon. Piercing Climb (Climb 8 ranks) : You can use piercing weapons to climb as if your hands were free. You take a \u20134 penalty on Stealth checks while doing so. You can take 10 on such Climb checks even while distracted or endangered. Weapon Juggle ( Two-Weapon Fighting ) :  Martial Arts Handbook pg. 14  You can draw a weapon even while wielding two weapons. Doing so takes the same type of action as drawing that weapon normally would. As part of the action to draw the weapon, you must sheathe one of the two weapons you were wielding.  Weapon and Shield Tricks Source   Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 9 These weapon tricks are common in Taldor, where they are used by rondelero fighters, and Lastwall, where they are taught in the Crusader\u2019s War College. You can use these tricks only while wielding a shield and a weapon you can wield in one hand. Confounding Shield (Bluff 5 ranks) : You can always take 10 on Bluff checks to feint in combat. Feint and Bash ( Improved Feint ,  Improved Two-Weapon Fighting , Bluff 10 ranks) : When you feint successfully against a foe you threaten with your shield, that foe provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You can only perform a shield bash with this attack of opportunity. Shielded View (Knowledge [dungeoneering] 1 rank) : When you avert your eyes to avoid a gaze attack, you have an 80% chance to avoid having to attempt a saving throw against the gaze. Warded Movement ( Dodge ) : As a swift action, you can choose a foe you can see. You can pass through that foe\u2019s threatened area without provoking attacks of opportunity from that foe this round. Once you target a foe with this trick, you can\u2019t target it again that day. Block and Counter ( Two-Weapon Fighting ) :  Martial Arts Handbook pg. 14  You can ready a standard action to block an attack with your shield, making an attack roll as though you were making a shield bash and using the result as your AC against that attack. If you successfully block the attack, you can attack that opponent with the weapon in your other hand as an immediate action. Shield Charge ( Shield Focus ,  Double Slice , base attack bonus +11) :  Martial Arts Handbook pg. 14  When you make a charge attack, you can attack twice\u2014once with your shield and once with the weapon you are wielding in your other hand, applying the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons to each.
